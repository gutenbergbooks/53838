<h1>VIRGINIA OF VIRGINIA.</h1>

<h2 id="I">I.</h2>

<p>“It’s a girl,” said Roden, laying a wager
with himself. “No; it’s a boy.
Hanged if it isn’t a girl!” He took his
short brier-wood pipe from his mouth,
knocked out its contents against the side
of the wagon, and pocketed it.</p>

<p>The time of the year was January, the
scene a country road in Virginia, and it
was drizzling, a thick Scotch drizzle, abetted
by a lusty east wind. Even the branches
of the straggling locust-trees that lined
the red road seemed clogged with it. It
hung in folds upon the sides of the mountains,
and was blown in masses between the
clefts of the rolling meadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Roden was not only a new arrival in
Virginia, but in America, and the impression
made upon him had not, to speak
very moderately, been favorable. Coming
from Washington, some one in the train
had asked him if it did not remind him
of England. He had answered with some
curtness that it did not, demanding at the
same time why he should be particularly
reminded of England by the state of the
weather in Virginia. His interlocutor had
replied with the never-failing urbanity of
the Virginian farmer, that “anybody could
tell he was an Englisher by th’ way he
talked, and them loose pants.”</p>

<p>At the moment he first saw the figure
alluded to, the owner of the British accent
and the “loose pants” was shivering
in spite of the top-coat turned up about
his ears and the soft hat pulled down to
meet it.</p>

<p>It was indeed a girl; she wore a soft
hat, the counterpart of his own, fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the same stuff as her dark-gray jacket
and the kirtle which reached just below her
knees. On her legs were shooting-gaiters
of russet leather, decidedly influenced as to
color by the tyrannic soil, and on her feet
stout cowhide boots. She carried a gun
on her shoulder, and a game-bag hung
at her side. She further appeared to be
bounded on the east, west, north, and south
by dogs. An old mastiff lounged sulkily
at her heels. Far in front, a collie gave
chase to a stately buzzard, which sailed
away undisturbed by its pursuer’s shrill
barking, while an asthmatic pug sought a
Juggernautal fate between the ponderous
wagon-wheels, and a little black-and-tan terrier,
sniffing hither and thither among the
mist-drenched weeds, reminded Roden of
the accounts of certain mammoth ants as
related by the credulous Herodotus.</p>

<p>The girl, who had been walking with
head bent, looked up as the creaking of
the wagon-wheels arrested her attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Roden, “but
can you tell me if I am on the right road
to Caryston Hall? I think that’s the
name.”</p>

<p>She looked at him seriously for a moment,
and then said, “Yes, you are. I
s’pose you’re th’ new Englishman. Are
you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Roden. “My name
is Roden. I have bought a farm somewhere
in this neighborhood, and it is called
Caryston Hall.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” she said; “you’re right. My
father’s th’ overseer there. Why don’t you
get down and walk? You look so cold.
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Roden; “I think I
will;” and he jumped down beside her.</p>

<p>Judging by her attire, he had at first
thought her a sporting country-woman of
his own, like himself an exile in a far country;
but after she had spoken he found that
the soft, slow intonation was strange to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ear. “The overseer business explains it,”
he thought. “She is a native, and this language
is Virginian.” In the mean time
the girl was also making mental observations.
He was the third English gentleman
she had seen, though of immigrant
Britishers she had known full threescore
and ten. She was thinking that he had
spoken to her with an unusual civility, and
wondering how long it would continue.
Civility this young Virginian had not
found to be a characteristic of the British
settler in her native State.</p>

<p>“I’m very lucky to have met you,” said
Roden, as they walked on, having dismissed
the services of the ancient wagoner,
whom the girl addressed as “Unc’ Dick.”
“I would like to ask you some questions
about the place, and it’s awfully kind of you
to go back with me.”</p>

<p>She said, indifferently, and without lifting
her eyes this time, “Oh, I was goin’
back anyway! ’Tisn’t any bother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Her long strides matched Roden’s exactly,
and the rapid motion through the stiffly
yielding medium under foot began to warm
his veins. They saw the serpentine flourish
of Unc’ Dick’s voluminous whip-lash
outlined against the pale sky as the wagon
descended a hill just in front of them.
Two more buzzards appeared, slanting in
still absorption towards the west. Instantly
the collie was after them.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you telegraph?” said the
girl, suddenly.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Roden, with some grimness.
“I telegraphed twice. I also had the pleasure
of rereading both telegrams when I arrived
at the station about an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” she said, turning to look
over her shoulder at the mastiff, pug, and
terrier, that were having a tow-row over an
old shoe (which same seem to be sown in
lieu of corn in the thorns by the Virginian
way-side)&mdash;“Seems to me that letters reach
us twice as quick as telegrams, anyhow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
You must have thought it funny we didn’t
send for you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I found it very amusing,”
said Roden, truthfully, adding, in a
tone of helpless aggravation, “All my luggage
was left behind in Washington.”</p>

<p>At this direct appeal the overseer’s
daughter at first looked as sorrowful as
even Roden could have desired, bursting
the next moment into peals and roulades
of laughter. Roden, after the first sharp
inclination to feel angry, joined in her
mirth.</p>

<p>“Pore feller!” she said at last, taking off
her rain-soaked hat, on which she appeared
to dry her brimming eyes&mdash;“Pore feller!
it all seems awful to you out here, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does,” said Roden in his heart, but
out loud he replied with mendacious civility
that it did not. He was, moreover, occupied
in a close scrutiny of her uncovered
locks. They were of a pale golden color,
lying close to her forehead in thick, round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
rings, after the manner of a child’s, and
clustering heavily, with the dampness. As
he stood beside her he saw also that she
was very tall, taller than most tall women,
and that her fair throat, rising boy-like from
a dark-red kerchief, had unusual suggestions
of muscle beneath its smooth surface.</p>

<p>Presently they walked on. The top of a
tolerably high hill was soon reached, surmounted,
as Roden at first thought, by an
almost impenetrable thicket. As they approached
nearer, however, he perceived an
aperture in the mass of foliage, and a long
wooden gate, hanging by one hinge in an
aimless, desultory manner, and ornamented
also as to its dingy gray with copious
splashes of red mud. On either post were
rusty iron vases, wherefrom there sprouted
two stunted specimens of the aloe tribe.
One of these vases, having been broken
some years before, hung over to one side
with a suggestion of inanimate sentimentality
highly ludicrous. Some kind Samaritan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had thrust a stick in between its disabled
joints, thus preventing it from utter
downfall.</p>

<p>The view beyond the gate was unique,
and to Roden rather pleasant after his
morning’s experience. The lawn proper
was shaped like a lady’s slipper, and outlined
by a gravel carriage-drive. It seemed
as though some Titaness might have
set a careless foot among the surrounding
shrubbery, crushing out of existence all
save a bordering fringe of evergreen and
acacias. The long, low house of red brick&mdash;with
wings out-spread after a protective,
hen-like fashion in the direction of the
many out-houses&mdash;was to be seen through
the bare branches of two splendid tulip-trees.
A little Alderney heifer was grazing
near the portico, and some dorkings
stood resignedly on long yellow legs under
the shelter of the large box-bushes.</p>

<p>As they worked along the sinuous carriage-way
Roden looked with a feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ownership at the glimpses of distant hill
and forest, as visible through the crowding
tree-stems. Here he was to make his
home for at least the next two years, and
he was glad not to find it so bad as he
had expected.</p>

<p>As she opened the hall door the girl
said to him, “Father won’t be here until
six o’clock. I’ll have you some dinner ef
you want it. But you’d better go to your
room first, hadn’t you, you’re so wet?&mdash;I’ll
send you some things the larst Englishman
left behind him. There’s a barth
ready, and plenty of towels. I’m used to
fixin’ for you English, you see. Well, good-by
till you’re dressed; then I’ll show you
over the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div id="illus2" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“I CAN’T COME TO DINNER.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>She sent a little “nigger,” who conducted
him with wordless dignity to the apartment
allotted him, and who some five minutes
later returned again with the “last
Englishman’s things.” That personage
must have been of very slight proportions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and medium height, whereas Roden stood
six foot one in his stockings, and was of
excellent figure. He struggled for some
time with the meagre garments, and then
decided that he could not put in an appearance
until his own garments should be dry.
At this moment some one knocked at the
door with the announcement&mdash;“Dinner
rade-y.”</p>

<p>“I can’t come to dinner,” said Roden at
the key-hole. “The clothes won’t fit me.
Say I am very sorry.”</p>

<p>The departing footsteps echoed down
the narrow corridor that led to the room
which had been given him, and Roden, who
had taken the silk coverlet from the bed
and rolled himself in it, stretched out before
the fire of pine cones in the big fireplace.
The room was large and square,
and had hangings of faded green silk embroidered
with tarnished gold. A ponderous
mahogany wardrobe, looking like nothing
so much as a grim wooden mausoleum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
occupied nearly all of one wall. Facing
this on the opposite side of the room was
a low chest of drawers, also of mahogany,
with brass lion-head handles. A square
mirror in a wrought-brass frame hung over
it. The bedstead was low and wide, with
foot-board and head-board of a like height.
Voluminous curtains of faded green fell
from a mahogany frame fastened to the
ceiling, and were tucked back behind brass
knobs on either side of the bed. There
was a huge pale-green paper screen crowded
into one corner of the room, and behind
this Roden discovered a bath-tub and a
washhand-stand. One picture hung over
the mantle-shelf, a reproduction of the Madonna
of the Chair, done evidently with a
very hard and very pointed lead-pencil, and
faintly tinted with pink chalk as to lips and
cheeks.</p>

<p>Roden lay in the soft embrace of his one
Indian-like garment and stared up at this
work of art. He became fascinated in wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
how many days it must have taken
its indefatigable perpetrator to make the
million of little scratches that composed it.
He wondered if it were the production of
generations past or present. Could Virginia
herself have been guilty of it? He
thought not. At all events he hoped not.
Her voice seemed to put her beyond the
pale of such possibilities. He recalled it
to his memory’s ear now, with a distinct
sensation of pleasure. There had been in
it a certain rich sonorousness. It was
grave, serious, soft as the rush of the rain
through the short grass without. A beautiful
voice attracts men always, even as the
<i lang="fr">timbre</i> of a fine instrument invariably attracts
a musician. It is, so to speak, the
overture to the whole character. No; the
pink-cheeked Virgin, with the slate-colored
infant tilted against her wooden and unresponsive
bosom, could never have been the
work of the maiden in the Rosalind costume.
Never, never! Why, now that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
thought of it, should the cheeks of the pictured
Madonna so blush? unless, perhaps,
at the culpable drawing of her sacred proportions.
Why should she have been drawn
at all? There was absolutely no reason
that he could discover. The pine cones
crackled and blazed up with a savory smell.
The fragrant warmth stole pleasantly over
the young fellow’s relaxed limbs. The pink-and-gray
Madonna faded slowly and surely
away in a golden haze. There was a pleasant
humming as of a summer field within
his ears. Why did he seem to be pulling
up a scarlet window-blind, which obstinately
refused to remain in position, in order to
let three large black sheep gambol at their
pleasure about that imposing mahogany
catafalque? And why did the loss of a
brass key at least three feet long, and which
seemed to belong to his hat-box, occasion
him such acute mortification when called
upon by a very old woman in blue kid low-shoes
to explain its whereabouts? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
why did&mdash;and why didn’t&mdash;and what on
earth made them all? Roden had not
slept so soundly since leaving British soil.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a vigorous rapping
at the door. He sat up and rolled himself
more tightly in the big green silk quilt.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” he said.</p>

<p>“’Tis yo’ clo’es,” replied a solemn voice.
“An’ please, sur, ter dress ez quick ez you
kin, ’case supper soon be rade-y.”</p>

<p>Roden admitted his once more dry outfit
through a small aperture in the door,
after having inquired as to the time, and
finding that he had slept two hours.</p>

<p>“Miss Faginia she say ez how she ben
think you’d rayther eat yo’ supper jiss so,
’thout sp’ilin’ it with er sorter dinner,”
chanted the monotonous voice without.</p>

<p>Roden admitted that “Miss Faginia”
had been quite right in her conjecture.
In half an hour he went out into the big
hall, which, divided by three arches, ran
through the centre of the house. Over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
first was a fine moose-head. There were
skins of many beasts here and there on the
slippery oak floor, and straight-backed
chairs set against the panelled wall, which
some barbarian had painted white. A
much-carved oak table on one side supported
a large silver flagon and two old-fashioned
tankards. On the other was an
old-fashioned hat-rack, filled mostly with
feminine head-gear of various makes and
sizes. A pair of branchy antlers supported
riding-canes of all descriptions.</p>

<p>Guided by the sounds of a piano softly
played, Roden opened a door on his left,
and found himself in a large firelit room,
whose walls were absolutely covered with
pictures large and small, all in old Italian
frames, all more or less stiff and ill painted,
all hung, regardless of size or shape, as
close to one another as they could possibly
be placed. The effect of the thus concentrated
colors was, in spite of the defects of
the pictures themselves, quaint and jewel-like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Over the mantle of carved oak
reached upward to the ceiling an enormous
square mirror in the style of the First Empire.
On one side of the room was hung
its mate, also in lonely grandeur, and facing
the portrait of a very rosy dame in a
still rosier tulle dress, the whole suggesting
in color the presence of the all-pervading
Virginian soil.</p>

<p>Just under this second mirror was a
piano, and at this piano was standing the
overseer’s daughter, striking idle chords
with her left hand.</p>

<p>She had taken off her Rosalind costume,
and appeared in a blue homespun
dress, neat and scant of make, and with
her two big braids hanging over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you!” she said, addressing
Roden. “I was just trying th’ piano to
see ’f any ’v the keys’d stuck since the last
Englishman left; but th’ haven’t. D’you
like music?” she went on, in her vibrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
voice, which seemed in some strange manner
to harmonize with the firelight and the
now steady hum of the rain without. “I’ll
tell you, before you say anything, I can
play very well.”</p>

<p>Roden found her open conceit a very
novel and amusing sensation, but when she
had struck a few chords firmly, her long
fingers sinking in among the keys as might
the fingers of a miser among the gold coin
that he loved, he thought no more of anything
save the melody that filled the room.</p>

<p>“Gad!” said he, when she had ceased,
“I should say you could play, rather!
Where on earth&mdash;who taught you?”</p>

<p>“No one,” she said, absently, striking
noiseless chords with her left hand, and
not looking at him. “I’ve heard people,
and I do’t by ear. And the men that’ve
had th’ Hall’ve been awful kind ’bout lettin’
me play&mdash;an’ that’s all,” comprehensively&mdash;adding,
with sudden irrelevance,
“Were your clothes quite dry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite,” he assured her; “but they are
beastly dirty to come to supper in.”</p>

<p>“I dried them myself,” she continued,
taking no notice of his last assertion.
“Such work as I had, too! I really think
if Milly hadn’t helped me, you’d ’a’ been in&mdash;in&mdash;in
your green silk quilt now.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward for some moments,
laughing, with her head against the music-rack,
so that the piano reverberated shrilly
with the clear sound. Roden laughed with
her.</p>

<p>“Who told you&mdash;the little nigger?” he
asked. “And who is Milly?”</p>

<p>She got suddenly to her feet, as suddenly
becoming grave, and closed the piano.</p>

<p>“Milly’s one o’ th’ darkies,” she said.
“Come and get your supper.”</p>

<p>He followed her across the wide hall
into the dining-room, and found that supper
at Caryston Hall was a very pretty
meal. It was served on finest but much-darned
damask, by the light of six tall candles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in silver candlesticks, each ornamented
by a little petticoat of scarlet silk, which
gave them the appearance of diminutive
coryphées pirouetting on one slender wax
leg. A bowl of violets and primroses occupied
the centre of the table, flanked on
either side by crystal dishes, filled, the one
with the pale amber of honey, the other
with the deep crimson of cranberries.</p>

<p>The overseer’s daughter poured out tea
behind a great silver urn, while on her
right hand a monstrous cut-glass flagon
foamed with richest milk. “Positively
artistic,” thought Roden, feeling a certain
respect in his British breast for this little
maiden of Virginia who could evolve out
of her own country-bred brain effects so
charming. “It’s a beastly pity!” he told
himself, though in what the pity consisted
he could not quite have told any one else,
unless perhaps that a being so gifted with
a talent for instrumental music, and the
setting forth of appetizing supper-tables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
should be hemmed in from further progress
by the scarlet soil of her native State,
and should murder his sovereign’s language
with ruthless regularity by beheading
some words and cutting the remainder
in two.</p>

<p>He also pondered somewhat as to the
way in which Virginian overseers and their
children expected to be treated by resident
foreigners. He noticed that the girl ate
nothing herself, sitting with her hand in her
lap after she had poured out his cup of tea,
and pulling idly at the frayed edge of the
table-cloth, with eyes downcast. He wished
very much that he knew how to address
her, and was casting about in his mind as
to how he might find out her surname without
being rude, when she answered him directly.</p>

<p>“My name is Virginia”&mdash;she said “Faginia”&mdash;but
it came softly to the ear&mdash;“Virginia
Herrick.”</p>

<p>“They ought to have called you ‘Julia,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Miss Herrick,” said the young Englishman,
gravely regarding her grave face.</p>

<p>“Why?” she said, with her swift change
from listless to alert&mdash;“why ought they?
It’s a hijeous name, I think.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t very pretty&mdash;not near so pretty
as ‘Faginia,’” said Roden, gallantly; “but
there was a fellow once called Herrick who
was always writing songs to ‘Julia.’”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the girl, with a sudden dawning
in her sombre eyes, “that’s the man
wrote ‘To Daffodils’ and ‘Primroses’ and
things, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well,” she replied, slowly, “I don’t see
why I ought to be called Julia. Her last
name wa’n’t Herrick, ’cause he wouldn’t ’a’
written those kynder things to his sister,
and a man wouldn’t ’a’ taken th’ trouble to
write songs to’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Roden, fixing on her his
eyes, at whose blueness she began to wonder
in a vague way. Thus looking out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the young man’s sunburnt, weather-marked
face they reminded her of some vivid,
sky-colored flower springing into sudden
azure among brown summer grasses.</p>

<p>“Why?” he repeated. “Are all Virginian
husbands so ungallant to their wives?”</p>

<p>“So what?” she said, contracting her level
brows.</p>

<p>“So rude, so careless of their wives.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon so,” she made answer. “I
don’t know much ’bout men ’n’ their wives.
My father’s died when I was born, an’ somehow
I don’t take much to women, nor they
tuh me. But I know ’nuff,” she supplemented,
“to know a man ain’t goin’ to make
a fuss over ’s wife.”</p>

<p>“If you ever marry,” said Roden, “do
you think you will put up with that sort of
thing?”</p>

<p>“Sho!” she exclaimed, rising and pushing
back her chair, which made a sharp sound
on the polished oak of the floor. “I’ll never
marry in <em>this</em> world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you certainly won’t in the next,”
said Roden, smiling broadly; “that is, if
you’re orthodox.”</p>

<p>“What o’dox?” she said, pausing to question
him, with one hand on the table.</p>

<p>“Orthodox&mdash;if you believe all that the
Bible tells you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t,” she said, quickly; “not
by a long sight. I don’t believe all those
things got into one place like that ark without
killin’ each other clean out. An’ I don’t
believe those b’ars eat them children for
laughin’ at that ole feller’s bal’ head (I’ve
laughed at many of ’em myself, an’ no b’ars
’ain’t ever eat me; an’ if ’twas right then,
’twould be right now). No, I cert’n’y ain’t
or-or-orth’dox,” said Miss Virginia Herrick,
beginning to clear away the supper-dishes.</p>

<p>“You’re not commonplace, at all events,”
Roden told himself, as, after having obtained
her permission to smoke, he lighted a cigarette.
It was now past eight o’clock, and
still no signs of the recreant overseer. Roden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
occupied himself with putting many
questions of a more business-like character
to Miss Herrick, as she moved about the
room restoring things to their proper places.
He found that the little petticoats which ornamented
the candles were some more of
the things left by “the last Englishman;”
and that the primroses and violets grew in
what was called the “greenhouse,” a narrow
glass-fronted corridor reaching along
the front of the east wing of the house, and
opening out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>He said he would like to go in to look at
it, and she at once conducted him there,
carrying no candle, since a full-moon looked
in at them through the lattice of the winter
trees. A thick soft air, spongy with dampness,
closed about them. The flowers rose
dark and redolent on all sides. Roden could
make out the large, bunchily growing leaves
of a magnolia-tree outside, seen in rich relief
against the dim sky.</p>

<p>Roden, who had an artistic soul, found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
much pleasure in watching her. He was
beginning to think that in her own unique
way she was beautiful, and she was certainly
shaped like a young caryatid.</p>

<p>After she had answered various queries
about house and out-house, niggers and
stables, they returned to the dining-room,
and lifting one of the tall candlesticks from
a side-table, she opened one of the many
doors.</p>

<p>“I’m going to father’s room,” she announced;
“’f you like you can come too.
Most of ’em” (alluding probably to the preceding
Englishmen)&mdash;“most of ’em liked
to smoke there. I’ve got my spinnin’ an’
some things to do. Ef you want to stay
here, there’s books.” She made a comprehensive
sweep with her candleless hand in
the direction of a low bookcase which ran
around three sides of the room.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll come with you, if you really
don’t mind,” said Roden.</p>

<p>“Lor’, no!” she hastened to assure him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
“But ’f you don’t like dogs an’ ’coons an’
things, you’d better not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind ’coons and&mdash;and
things,” said Roden, somewhat vaguely.
“I’ll come, thank you.”</p>

<p>They went down a long hall, descended
a little stair-way whereon the moonlight fell
bluely through a square window high above,
down more steps, along another passage
with sharp turns, and in at an already open
door. An old negress, vividly turbaned,
was heaping wood upon an already immense
fire.</p>

<p>“Lor’, mammy!” called Miss Herrick,
“for mercy’s sakes stop! ’F you put any
more wood on that fire you’ll have to get
up on th’ roof an’ shove ’t down th’ chimney.”
The “’coons and things” were already
crowding about them.</p>

<p>Roden recognized several of his canine
friends of the morning, and there were,
moreover, two splendid old hounds, which
at sight of their evidently beloved “Faginia”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
set up a most booming yowl of welcome.
There were also the ’coon; a curious
flat-stomached little beast, that flew
about after a startling fashion from chair
to chair, and which Miss Herrick introduced
as a “chipmunk;” a corn-crake; a
young screech-owl; and three large Persian
cats.</p>

<p>All these pets, he discovered later, had
been presented from time to time by the
“last Englishman,” or “the Englishman
before the last,” or “the Englishman before
the one with the glass eye,” or the fat
wife, or the ugly sister, or what not.</p>

<p>“If I can only add a gorilla or a condor
to this unique collection,” reflected Roden,
“my position is assured. I will probably
be forever the ‘last Englishman,’ and I will
always be mentioned as ‘the Englishman
who gave me the gorilla.’”</p>

<p>He then sat down in a corner as far removed
as was consistent with politeness
from the other inhabitants of the apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and occupied himself with watching
“Faginia,” her “mammy,” and the “things.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Tishy,” said Miss Herrick, indicating
him with a movement of her bright
head, as he sat withdrawn into his coign of
vantage, like a hermit-crab within its shell,
“that’s the new Englishman, Mr. Roden.”</p>

<p>“How yo’ do, sur? Hope yo’ coporosity
segastuate fus rate, sur,” quoth the dusky
dame, with an elephantine dab, supposed in
the innocence of her Virginian heart to
correspond to the courtesy of civilization.</p>

<p>“My what?” said Roden.</p>

<p>“She means she hopes you are well,”
explained Virginia, about whose neck the
raccoon was coiling himself with serpentine
affection.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, thanks, very well. Are you?”
said Roden.</p>

<p>“Gord! yes, sur; Tishy she <em>al’uz</em> well&mdash;ain’
she, honey?” This last appeal to Virginia.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said that young woman “’cep’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
when you get th’ misery, or th’ year-ache in
th’ middle o’ th’ coldest nights, an’ have me
huntin’ all over creation for somethin’ to
put in your year. Oh yes!”</p>

<p>“G’way, chile!” exclaimed the thus maligned
personage, with an air of indignant
sufferance. “If I didn’ know yer wuz jess
projeckin’, I sutny would feel bade.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, you wouldn’t,” said her mistress,
easily. “<em>This</em> one,” again indicating Roden,
“’s goin’ in fur horse-racin’. Some of his
horses’s comin’ day after to-morrer. That’s
better’n Herefordshire cattle, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Co’se <em>you</em> think so,” said Aunt Tishy,
with something between a sniff and a
grunt, as she settled herself in the chimney-corner
with a basket of darning, and
fell to work, stretching the stockings to be
mended over a little gourd.</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Tishy?” said Roden, beginning
to feel as though he were a character
in a book, and might spoil the plot by saying
the wrong thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The old negress looked up at him over
her big gold-rimmed spectacles, with her
great underlip pushed out, showing its pale
yellowish lining.</p>

<p>“Lor’! sur,” she said, “Miss Faginny’s
plum crazy ’bout horses. Ev’ybody on de
place’ll tell you dat. I alwuz hol’s as how
somebody done cunjur her mar ’fo’ she was
bown. Dat’s why she so run made ’bout
horses. Somebody sutny <em>is</em> cunjur Miss
Faginny. I’ll say dat with my last bref!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, mammy!” here interpolated
Virginia.</p>

<p>“I sutny will,” reiterated the old black.</p>

<p>“Cert’n’y will what?” said Miss Herrick;
“shut up? I’m sure I hope so, and I know
Mr. Roden does.”</p>

<p>She rose and put down the raccoon, who
immediately clambered up to the carven
top of an old oak press close by, and hung
there, smiling genially.</p>

<p>Virginia busied herself in getting out her
spinning-wheel and winding the distaff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with blue wool. As she sat down to her
spinning, with her closely plaited fair hair
falling into her lap, a novel thought suggested
itself to Roden, namely, that this blond
maiden might be a Desdemona dressed up
as Marguerite, with the Moor concealed as
her nurse.</p>

<p>He watched with a strange sensation of
unreality the whirring wooden wheel, the
soft falling of the blue thread upon the
floor, the dusky smoke-stained rafters of
the room, wherefrom hung strings of onions
and red peppers in gay festoons; the old
negress, wrinkled as to her black face with
busy absorption; the moving of the different
creatures in the sombre depths of
shadow. Now it was the glint of the corn-crake’s
flame-like crest as he thrust an inquisitive
head from his position on a shelf
over the mantle. Now the white gleam of
the raccoon’s sharp teeth as he grinned
with an amiable persistency upon the room
and its inmates. Now the old hounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
grumbled uneasily in their sleep, or the
Persian cats leaned against his legs with
luxurious, undulating appeals to be caressed.</p>

<p>“Why don’ yo’ sing, honey?” said Aunt
Tishy; “yo’ know yo’ kyarn’ harf wuk ef
yo’ don’ sing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do sing, Miss Virginia,” said Roden.
“A nig&mdash;I mean a darky song,” he
added, quickly.</p>

<p>“What shall I sing, mammy?” questioned
she.</p>

<p>“Dat ’pen’s on whut kinder song de gen’leman
wants.”</p>

<p>“Well, what kind do you want?” she
asked him.</p>

<p>“Something characteristic,” he replied.</p>

<p>Thus adjured, she sang to him, in a very
rich contralto voice, the following ditty:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before Roden could say anything, she
rose and put aside her spinning-wheel,
holding out to him her long shapely hand,
which was covered with tan as with a
brown glove to within about an inch of her
homespun sleeve. “Good-night,” she said;
“I’m sleepy. Father won’t be here now
till tuh-morrer. I s’pec’ he slept at Cyarver’s.
Everything’s ready&mdash;your barth an’
everything.”</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, Roden took himself off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to bed. As he dropped to sleep to the
tune of “Ole ark a-movin’,” he was conscious
of uncomfortable memories concerning
haunted rooms in old Virginian mansions.
Not that he believed in ghosts&mdash;Heaven
forbid!&mdash;but some one might&mdash;some
little nigger, you know&mdash;might play
one a trick.</p>

<p>He was roused suddenly and unpleasantly
by three solemn raps on the door at his
bed’s head.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;what is it?” he said, in an unnecessarily
loud tone.</p>

<p>“’Tis me&mdash;Aun’ Tishy,” replied an unmistakable
voice. “Please come to de do’,
sur, jess a minute.”</p>

<p>He answered this appeal, opening the
door cautiously an inch or two, whereupon
she thrust into his hands a little white
bundle.</p>

<p>“Dis heah’s fo’ yo’ to war tuh-night.
Marse Gawge he don’ war no night-shuts,
and dey am none o’ th’ other Englishers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lef’ none; so I jess stole you one o’ Miss
Faginny’s. Don’ say nothin’ ’bout it,
please, sur, ’case ef dar <em>is</em> one thing Miss
Faginny’s ’tic’lar ’bout, ’tis her clo’es.”</p>

<p>Roden took the long white garment gingerly,
as men lift a young baby, bade Aunt
Tishy good-night, and closed the door.
He then went to the fire and began to examine
what that colossal personage had
inferred to be “Miss Faginny’s night-shut.”</p>

<p>It was a capacious arrangement of very
thin linen, and superfine little frills of a
like material&mdash;hardly the garment in which
an overseer’s daughter would have wooed
repose. The young man looked at it carefully
and gravely from all points of view,
then went and hung it over the mirror, and
returning to bed, regarded it with the mute
attention which he had before bestowed on
the drab-colored Madonna. It was a dainty
thing, probably a relic of some previous
Englishman’s wife or daughter, and the
rosy light from the handful of fresh cones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which he had thrown on the fire stole in
and out of its sheer folds caressingly.</p>

<p>He left it hanging there, and the last
thing he remembered that night was its
gleam, as of a pretty ghost in the firelit
dusk of the big room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="II">II.</h2>

<p>He could have sworn that he had slept
but a moment when a terrific squeaking
and squealing, yelping and growling, under
his windows, aroused him with sufficient
abruptness.</p>

<p>His first idea was that the “’coons and
things” were “killin’ each other clean out,”
after the fashion of Miss Virginia’s supposition
in regard to the Scriptural beasts in
the story of the ark.</p>

<p>Looking out, however, he saw that a
large black and white hog was being
chased, nipped, barked at, and otherwise
maltreated by the mastiff and the collie.
The frightened beast rushed hither and
thither, squealing and grunting, and the
two dogs followed, falling over each other
in the eagerness of pursuit. After a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the mad trio disappeared to the farther end
of the long terrace.</p>

<p>Dawn had just broken. The east was
one deep even tone of mellow gold, translucent,
palpitating. Over against it lay
gray streamers as of a tattered banner.
The morning-star seemed to spin with a
cold blue glitter as of ice in the voluptuous
saffron of its setting. A band of trees
stood out against the vivid east, with bold
relief of indigo leaves and branches, like a
gigantic tracery of unknown hieroglyphics.
Over field and lawn a white steam rose
and melted slowly&mdash;blue hill and tawny
meadow appearing and disappearing as the
pearly masses rolled together or dissolved.</p>

<p>Roden heard with supreme delight the
confidential voice of a little nigger announcing
through the key-hole (their favorite
channel of communication) that his
“trunks dun come.”</p>

<p>He got with all speed through his ablutions,
and, when his boxes were brought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
into a well-worn shooting-coat and knickerbockers,
determining as he laced his hob-nailed
boots to “do” the farm thoroughly
that morning, and devote the rest of the
day to mountain-climbing and explorations
generally.</p>

<p>As he went out on the square portico at
the front of the house he met Miss Herrick,
again in her boy’s dress, leading the
mastiff and the collie with either hand.
She had evidently been to the rescue of
the black and white hog, and both dogs
had a sneaky appearance, as though they
knew a flogging was in store for them.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” she said to Roden, with her
grave directness of regard. “How’d you
sleep?”</p>

<p>Before he could reply, a voice, rising in
long, wailing tones upon the chill air, interrupted
them.</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o Po!” it called; “O-o-o-o <em>Po</em>!”
then a pause as if waiting for a reply. Then
again, “Aw-w-w Po-po! Aw-w-w <em>Po</em>-po!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s father callin’ Popo,” explained Virginia.</p>

<p>“Who’s Popo?
Another nigger?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” briefly.</p>

<p>“What does ‘Popo’
stand for? Napoleon?” questioned
Roden, much interested.</p>

<p>“No,” she said.
“’F you wait an’ listen
you’ll hear. Father
always calls like
that at first. ’F Po
answers tuhecly he’ll
jus’ stop. ’F he
don’t answer, father’ll
jus’ go on
callin’ till he says
th’ whole name.”</p>

<div id="illus3" class="figright" style="width: 170px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="170" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“AW-W-W POPO!”</p>
</div>

<p>Roden listened with absorbed attention.</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o Popo! Popo! Popo!” rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
out the voice, with angry staccato insistence.
“You Popo! Aw-w-w! you <em>Po</em>po!”
Then, presently, “O-o-o-o! you Po-po-cat-e-petl!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” said Roden, bursting
into laughter. “Is that really the poor
little devil’s name?”</p>

<p>“Mh&mdash;mh,” said Virginia, with a nod of
assent. “There was three of ’em born all
to oncet. One’s called Popocatepetl, an’
one Iztaccihuatl, an’ one Orizaba. We call
’em Popo, an’ Whattle, an’ Zabe.”</p>

<p>“That triumvirate ought to rule something,”
said Roden. “Could a nigger ever
be President, Miss Virginia? What a lark
it would be to speak of President Popocatepetl!
What’s the other name?”</p>

<p>“Page,” said Miss Herrick.</p>

<p>“Page!” echoed the young Englishman&mdash;“<em>Page?</em>
why surely that name belongs
to the ‘F.F.V.’s,’ doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“All the darkies took th’ name o’ th’
fam’lies they b’longed to after th’ war,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
explained. “I had a cook here oncet
called Faginia Herrick; she used to b’long
to father ’fo’ th’ war.”</p>

<p>“By gad!” was Roden’s sole remark.
“By <em>gad</em>!” said he again.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> needn’t say nothin’!” she exclaimed,
breaking suddenly into her melodious
laughter; “there’s two little right <em>black</em> niggers
at th’ mill, an’ one’s called Prince Albert
and th’ other Queen Victoria, ’n’ ’f you
leave off th’ ‘Prince’ or th’ ‘Queen’ they
won’t answer you, neether.”</p>

<p>She was evidently delighted with his expression
of face at this, and released the
two dogs in order to indulge more freely
in her mirthful mood. She sat down on
the stone steps, letting her arms hang simply
at her sides, and putting down her
head, laughed into the hollow lap of her
gray kirtle, as though confiding her surplus
merriment to its care.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the overseer
came into sight&mdash;a tall, gaunt man, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beard that seemed flying away with his
round head, after the fashion of a comet’s
tail; little steely blue eyes drawing close
to the bridge of his nose as though it magnetized
them; long, crooked teeth, not unlike
the palings in one of his own fences
for tint and irregularity; and a wide-open
square smile, like the smile of a Greek
comic mask. He wore a waistcoat of as
many hues as Joseph’s renowned garment,
a blue cotton shirt, ginger-colored trousers
tucked into heavy mud-crusted boots, and
a straw hat, impossible to describe, tilted
to the back of his head. In his arms he
carried the little black-and-tan terrier
which Roden remembered, and twisted its
untrimmed ears while talking.</p>

<p>“Howdy? howdy?” he remarked, genially.
“My darter Faginia’s tole me ’bout
you. Got all yo’ clo’es lef in Washin’ton?
Hey? Got ’em this mornin’? You don’
sesso? Well! My darter Faginia says as
how you’re goin’ in fur horse-racin’? That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
so? You don’ sesso? Well, what d’you
think er my darter Faginia, anyhow?
Darter, go ’n’ bring me some water; I’m
mortal thirsty.” Then, as the girl disappeared,
“Well, what d’you think er
her?”</p>

<p>“She seems to me very&mdash;very charming,”
ventured Roden.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you ’ain’t got no more idea
of th’ sweethearts that girl’s had&mdash;I mean
would ’a’ had ’f I’d ’lowed it. The las’ one
was Jim Murdoch, a hoop-pole man. But,
sir”&mdash;here Mr. Herrick assumed a tone of
the most pompous dignity&mdash;“but I will tole
you, sir, as how my darter Faginia shall
deceive <em>no</em> retentions, <em>respecially</em> from a
hoop-pole man!”</p>

<p>“A hoop-pole man?” said Roden.</p>

<p>“That thar’s hit, sir, an’ I cert’n’y means
what I says,” replied the overseer, relapsing
again into his former slipshod easiness of
speech and manner. “Consequently were,
the beauty of the question air my darter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Faginia won’t get married twel she gets a
mighty good offer.”</p>

<p>“I should say you were perfectly right,”
assented Roden.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, sir; I should sesso. I s’pose
you ain’t married, air you?”</p>

<p>“No. Do I look very like a married
man?” said Roden, who continued to be
amused. He thought the overseer almost
as interesting as Virginia.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” assented old Herrick, manipulating
his abundant beard with an
air of deep thought. “But the beauty
of the question air, you kyarn’t al’uz tell.
Them as looks the mostest married gen’ly
ain’t. An’ contrarywise, them as don’t,
air&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Married?” said Roden.</p>

<p>“Well, considerbul, mostly,” said the
overseer.</p>

<p>Here Virginia returned with a gourd of
water, keeping the quick-falling drops from
her father’s not too immaculate attire while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he drank by means of her skilfully hollowed
hands.</p>

<p>“Yo’ breakfas’ ’s ready,” she said over
her shoulder to Roden. He went in, and
found it to be a slight variation on the last
night’s meal. There were some corn-meal
cakes&mdash;batter cakes, Virginia called them&mdash;and
miraculously cooked mutton-chops.
A half-hour later the overseer appeared at
the window to offer his services as guide
over the farm.</p>

<p>When Roden returned from his investigations
it was one of the great clock in the
hall, and the sky like a vast blue banner
overhead.</p>

<p>He went out on the “front porch,” and
called to Herrick as he crossed “the yard,”
with the little terrier at his heels. “Is
there a good view from that hill just back
of the house?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mos’ people goes fyar crazy over it,”
said Herrick. “Hit’s a right rough climb
to the top. Want tuh go up? Faginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
kin show you. O-o-o-o-o Faginia! Faginia!”</p>

<p>Virginia appeared, clad from throat to
heels in a vast brown apron, her half-bare
arms covered with flour, and her thick
braids skewered across the top of her head
with a big wooden knitting-needle.</p>

<p>“Makin’ bread?” said her father. “Well,
yo’ kin get yo’ mammy to finish that. Mr.
Roden here he wants to go trapeezing up
to th’ top o’ Peter’s Mountain. I tole him
you could show him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” she said, briefly; “but I
kyarn’t walk: the Alderney heifer stepped
on my foot this mornin’. I’ll ride if you
like:” this last to Roden.</p>

<p>“By all means,” he said; “but if you do
not mind, I had rather walk.”</p>

<p>“Of co’se,” she said, and disappeared
again.</p>

<p>“The beauty of the question air,” said
her sire, looking proudly after her, “that
gyrl kin ride like a Injun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“She seems to do everything well,” said
Roden, with a pleased recollection of those
mutton-chops which Aunt Tishy had confided
to him “Miss Faginia done herself.”</p>

<p>“She cert’n’y does,” said Herrick, and
after making some unique excuse disappeared
also.</p>

<p>Miss Herrick appeared a few moments
later, again clad in her boyish attire, and
mounted upon a fidgety little roan mare.
She had slung a wicker basket from the
saddle, and Roden heard a merry clink as
of glass kissing silver when the mare sidled
about.</p>

<p>“That’s a clever-looking little nag,” said
Roden. “Is she yours?”</p>

<p>“Nuck,” said Virginia. “I reckon she’s
yours; she goes with the place.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her this morning,” Roden
said, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“No; she’d gone to the shop to get a
new shoe; that’s why. I reckon you’ll
name her over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” said Roden. It seemed to him
he had never put that monosyllabic question
so often before in the entire course of
his life.</p>

<p>“’Cause it ain’t very pretty,” Virginia
explained. “Father named her&mdash;it’s Pokeberry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Roden, laughing.
“I rather fancy it. It’s uncommon,
to say the least. I don’t think I’ll change
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s two others I <em>know</em> you’ll
change,” she asserted. “They’re two carriage-horses,
an’ they’re named Peckerwood
an’ Hoppergrass.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” said Roden, laughing again.
“Change them?&mdash;not much! Shall we
start now?”</p>

<p>It was a perfect day&mdash;perfect as only a
day in Southern winter-tide can be. The
air was radiant, wine-like, while with a still
further suggestiveness little glittering insects
spun around and around in the sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
like the particles of gold-leaf in eau-de-vie
de Dantzic. The roads, dried in
some sort by the steady wind of the past
night and morning, were mellowed to a
dull orange in lieu of their former startling
crimson. Infinite tones of faded browns
and grays wrapped wold and hill-side. The
sky, of an intense metallic pallor, was covered
with gauze-like masses of wind-torn
cirri. As they went on, a sycamore thrust
its bone-white arms before a dark hollow
in the mountain-side, reminding one of a
skeleton guarding the mouth of a cavern,
where during its life it had concealed some
treasure. The harsh call of crows, beginning
in the far east, passed in <i lang="it">crescendo</i>
above their heads, and died away as the
heavy birds flew westward.</p>

<p>Virginia, apparently unconscious of his
presence, was watching Roden narrowly as
he walked at her side. Owing to that peculiar
faculty with which only women are
endowed, she was enabled thus to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him while seemingly absorbed in the sun-shot
vista of the road before them. He
had taken off his coat, as the increasing
sunlight and the exertion of walking had
overheated him, and his flannel shirt expressed
damply the splendid modelling of
his supple body. She noticed how the sunburn
stopped in a line about his throat, the
fair flesh showing beneath with a girlish
whiteness, as is often the case with very
strong men.</p>

<p>“It’s a heap whiter than mine,” thought
Virginia.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d sing,” he said, suddenly.
“Will you?”</p>

<p>“A nigger song?” said the girl, with a
growing intuition in regard to his wishes.
She then sang as follows:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Roden was delighted with her rich, reed-noted
voice. She imitated the negroes’
tones to perfection. The inflection and
intonation were without fault.</p>

<p>“How well you do it!” he said. “It’s
really awfully pretty. Can’t you give me
another?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>She sang him one or two more, and ended
by repeating in a singsong fashion a little
rhyme which convulsed him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Mars’r had a leetle dorg,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“They make up all these things, of
course?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Virginia: “they’re awful
fond of ‘makin’ hymes,’ as they call it.
Here’s another:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He amused himself by trying to sing
some of the various ditties after her, but,
as they began to ascend the mountain,
found that he needed all the breath at his
command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The dead leaves, sodden with the winter
rains, closed in masses about the feet of
Pokeberry, and of the young Englishman
as he tramped untiringly at her muzzle.
The shaft of a young pine rose slender and
virginal from the lace-work of bare trees,
its plumy crest breaking with lucent emerald
the sea-blue reach of sky. A cardinal-bird
flashed, with unconscious contrast,
against the neutral tints of the woody distance,
meshed as it were in the multitudinous
glittering of sunlit twigs. From the
leaf-stirred silence, far in the heart of the
forest, came the urgent rat-a-plan of a woodpecker.
Dead leaves occasionally, loosened
by the fitful wind, fell, turning slowly
in their descent, now between the startled
ears of Pokeberry, themselves most leaf-like,
now upon Virginia’s skirt or hat, as she
sat wordless, listlessly supporting the reins
upon her knee.</p>

<p>They came presently to a narrow mountain
stream, clear and brown, over the sunken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
leaves. The sunlight through the swaying
tendrils of a wild grape-vine overhead
sent dim but sharply defined shadows wavering
back and forth over its bright surface,
as though, being spiritualized, they
breathed with a new life. A corn-crake,
moving cautiously among the withered water-grasses,
thrust forward its gay crest and
peered inquisitively at them, whereupon the
collie cleared the brook with an arching
bound, and set forth in mad pursuit of this
new quarry. The crake at once rose into
the blue lift, with the harsh, derisive cry
from which it takes its name.</p>

<p>After a while they came upon a log-cabin
set in a little patch of cleared ground. From
a small window close against the roof flaunted
a mud-stained curtain of sacking. The
red clay marks responded to a certain morbidness
in Virginia, by suggesting the wiping
of bloody hands upon the coarse stuff.
There had been a murder some years before
on this very mountain, and thoughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a grewsome sort were easily called forth in
her when remembering. A few black-and-white
pigs of the genus “nigger” hurtled
squealing down the hill-side, pursued by the
indefatigable collie, while a little fawn-colored
child, with whity-brown hair and purplish-white
eyes, stood in the door and apparently
bit its thumb at them.</p>

<p>“Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?”
quoted Roden, cheerily, whereat the little
darky fled, with a shrill “Yah!” of mingled
delight and terror, into the bacon-perfumed
room beyond.</p>

<p>They were now stopped by some draw-bars,
which passed, they found themselves
ascending a steep incline sown with large
stones, as though Jove and his giants might
have had a sharp encounter just in that
spot. But having gained the top of the
bluff, they came upon a view at which Roden
stood and stared in silent admiration.
It seemed to him that he had never before
so entirely realized the ball-like character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the earth. It seemed now to be swinging
like a magician’s globe, imprisoned in another
of larger size, which was hollowed
from some marvellous, million-colored gem.</p>

<p>The air had changed suddenly from balmy
warmth to a strange damp keenness, while
the sky, which had cleared on their way up,
was strewn from east to west with the same
woolly clouds which had at first covered it.
All above them was a lustrous monotone of
gray, brightening towards the east into a
pale daffodil, and farther towards the south
into a lurid orange. From south to west a
band of vivid violet-blue stretched solidly,
cleft here and there with wedges of pale
light slanting in regular order, like the bayonets
of a vast army marching eastward.</p>

<p>“That,” said Virginia, indicating the gorgeous
phenomenon, “means rain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think not,” said Roden, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Miss Herrick.</p>

<p>The wind blew ever stronger and stronger
from the north, shifting suddenly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
north-east. Virginia felt a heavy splash of
water upon her hand. She said nothing,
but held it out to Roden in silence, and at
the same moment the wind, scolding like an
old hag who has been deprived by some adventurous
urchin of her dinner, bore down
upon them.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Roden, “we are only
about a quarter of a mile from the top.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you put on your coat now?” said
Virginia, blinded by the blowing of her hair
into her eyes.</p>

<p>He replied that he did not feel the need
of it, and strode on a little ahead. The wind
sent his shirt in fine ripples across his back.
One could distinctly see the muscles at
work beneath the flexible skin. Strength,
above all things, was what this little barbarian
admired, and she saw it now in a perfection
which filled her with unconscious
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“My! couldn’t he double that braggin’
Joe Scott up!” she told herself. “Whew!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I’d like to see somebody make him right
mad. Couldn’t he lick ’em!”</p>

<p>As they neared the summit the gale became
more furious. Roden was obliged to
lead the thoroughly frightened mare, and
Virginia’s long hair, becoming unbound,
whipped with the sting of a lash across his
face. She recaptured and held it firmly
with one hand, while he, furtively observing
it, thought it must be at least two yards in
length. She assumed a new phase in his
eyes, wrapped thus in her plenteous tresses.
A certain boyish look, transmitted to her
through the medium of the short locks
about her brow, had vanished completely.
She looked like some mountain Godiva
hidden all as in a banner of cloth of gold.
Roden wondered if such marvellous hair
was a characteristic of Southern women.</p>

<p>They came at last to the one stunted
apple-tree which crowned the noble crest
of the mountain, with an effect as bathetic
as the scalp-lock of an Indian brave. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wind screamed through the gnarled ground-kissing
branches with the sound of a gale
through cordage. Pokeberry squatted ignominiously
in the fierce hurly, and put
back her nervous ears, while Virginia swung
from the saddle. Once on the ground, she
found that to keep the perpendicular was a
matter of some skill. She put one arm
around a mass of the tangled branches and
looked up at Roden with a laugh, which
was seized and dashed down the steep declivity
or ever it reached his ears. He in
the mean time having tethered the mare
securely, resumed his coat, and unbinding
his covert-coat from the saddle, offered to
help the girl on with it. She looked at him
in evident surprise, but made no resistance.
As she loosened the branches in order to
put her arms into the sleeves, which were
whirling wildly, with an air of reckless intoxication,
a sharp gust blew her, coat and
all, directly into Roden’s arms.</p>

<p>He laughed, disentangling himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
best he might from the wet bondage of
her heavy locks, but she, reddening vividly
through all her clear, sun-browned skin,
gave her attention to the garment that he
held. It seemed to her a strange thing
that he should offer to lend it. She had
been on rainy expeditions with many men,
both English and Virginian, while none that
she could remember had ever before offered
to protect her in such wise from the inclemency
of her native heavens.</p>

<p>She looked down a little consciously at
the weather-stained tan-color of the little
coat. She felt that it would be an insult
to suggest to so mighty a pedestrian the
idea of taking cold; at the same time she
was afraid that such would be the memento
he would bear away with him from the top
of Peter’s Mountain. As for herself, she
was as accustomed to wind and rain as one
of the big oxeye daisies in her own fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">ON THE TOP OF PETER’S MOUNTAIN.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s some sandwiches an’ a glass in
that basket,” she said, or rather shrieked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to Roden. He went to get them, tacking
through the stiff wind with much dexterity,
and they partook of thin slices of Aunt
Tishy’s bread and Virginian ham with a
heroic disregard of the downpour. All at
once they were confronted by a small ebon
figure, hatless and breathless.</p>

<p>“<em>Popo!</em>” said Miss Herrick; “what in
the name o’ sense are you doin’ here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Faginia, Miss Faginia,” howled
the little black, “de lightnin’ dun gone
thoo Marse Johnson’s house an’ kill he an’
he horg! An’ I wuz so skeered ’bout you
I jess took out an’ run up de mounting to
see ef you wuz all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am,” said his mistress. “You
pore little thing, how wet you are! Come
and get here under these branches.”</p>

<p>The faithful Popocatepetl came and
crouched on his heels at her side. He
was drenched to the skin, and his dark
hide showed in patches through his shirt
of some thin white stuff, which elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
puffed out in irregular blisters, like the
wet linen in a washer-woman’s tub. From
a strange freak of nature, not unusual in
these Virginian mountains, his knotty wool
was of a pale tan-color. It is a mistake to
think that the little negro perpetually grins.
Nothing absolutely could have been more
full of woe and resignation than the expression
of the young Popo as he watched
with Pokeberry the ceaseless flood that
swept over hill and valley.</p>

<p>Although comparatively sheltered, there
still escaped through the tangled apple-boughs
moisture sufficient to prove extremely
unpleasant. The large drops fell
heavy and monotonous, some into the furry
hollows of the mare’s flexile ears, causing
her to toss her head with a swift impatience
of movement that set the little metal
buckles on her head-gear tinkling faintly,
some upon Roden’s breast and hands, some
upon the uncovered head and cheeks of the
girl at his side. She tossed her head once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
or twice with a close reproduction of Pokeberry’s
impulsive gestures.</p>

<p>The surrounding mountains were by this
time entirely blotted from sight by the lead-colored
sheets of wind-urged rain. The
branches of the trees on the slopes below
them seemed living creatures, who, frantic
with alarm, tugged and twisted to free themselves
from their native boles, and to flee
before the ruffian wind that assaulted them.
Blown leaves, like troops of frightened birds,
were driven past in gusts. Not a sound
was to be heard save the ceaseless hiss of
the rain on the hard ground, the creaking
of the tortured trees, and the fluctuating
roar of the wind above all else. Pokeberry,
cowed and shivering, gazed wistfully down
at the swimming field below.</p>

<p>The darkness had increased palpably
within the last five minutes, and the wind,
raging downward through the stems of
the tall pines on the eastern slope of the
mountain, made a sound like to the angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
breathing of some giant through his
locked teeth.</p>

<p>“That is almost wolfish,” said Roden.</p>

<p>“There <em>was</em> wolves in these mountains
when my father was a little boy,” she responded.</p>

<p>Darker clouds seemed to be ever rolling
up from the east, veined with glittering
threads of lightning, which pierced the irregular
masses on all sides like the fronds
of an immense leaf. The trees on the slopes,
still wind-swept, seemed anon pale with terror
or dark with dread as their light and
dark leaves were alternately tossed upward.
Over against the west was a dull citrine
glare, like the smoke that overhangs a battle-field
on a sunlit day, reflected here and
there in the slimy soil and rain-roughened
waters of a stream some way beneath them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Virginia turned and swung out
of Roden’s coat with one of her swift movements.
“Please put it on,” she said to him.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he said; “I don’t want it. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
perfectly comfortable. I don’t know why I
brought it&mdash;unless from a happy inspiration
in regard to you,” he added, pleasantly. She
turned from him, and stooping, wrapped the
shivering Popo in it.</p>

<p>“They feel the cole so!” she said to Roden,
standing erect again. “An’ I never
wrop up.” Roden did not know whether
to laugh or to swear.</p>

<p>When the rain had abated somewhat, and
they returned to Caryston, he told himself,
as he soothed his inner man with some excellent
Scotch whiskey, that he “really rather
liked it in the girl; but&mdash;d&mdash;n the little
nigger!&mdash;that was my pet coat!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="III">III.</h2>

<p>Roden was the younger son of an Englishman
of title. He was also what is sometimes
graphically described as being <i lang="fr">sans le
sou</i>. It was his intention to try stud-farming
in Virginia. No better horseman than
Roden ever put boot in stirrup. He had,
as an old pad-groom once remarked, “a genus
for osses.” It was a mania, a fad of the
most pronounced type, with him. No woman’s
eye had ever possessed for him half the
charm that did the full orbs of his favorite
mare, Bonnibel, as she gazed lustrously
upon him over her well-filled manger. No
sheen of woman’s hair had ever vied, in his
opinion, with the satin flanks of Bonnibel.
What was it to love a woman? Was it
half the zest, the delight, of feeling a good
horse between one’s knees, what time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
welcome cry of “Gone away!” makes glad
delirium in one’s veins, while the music of
the spotted darlings thrills air and soul?
Roden would bluntly and unpoetically have
informed you that you were a “duffer” had
you attempted to argue the point. He had
never cared much for women, either collectively
or as individuals. They had perhaps
played too small a part in his life.
“Egad, sir!” his father had cried to him
one day in a fit of anger, “you’ll grow up
with a pair of legs like pot-hooks!”</p>

<p>Mr. Herrick informed him, on the second
day after his arrival, that “the beauty
of the question were, he cert’n’y did have a
mighty good foothold on a hawse.”</p>

<p>It was on that day also that most of the
horses arrived from New York&mdash;Bonnibel
among them. She was as beautiful a daughter
as Norseman ever sired. Deep of girth,
clean of limb, broad of loin, with splendid
oblique shoulders, bossed with sinew and
muscle which quivered with restrained power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
beneath the silky, supple hide; a small
compact head with ample front, over which
the sensitive leaf-like ears kept restless
guard; great limpid eyes, a crest like a
rainbow, and quarters to have lifted Leander
clean over the Hellespont. In color
she was a rich brown, touched with tan on
muzzle and flanks, while the slight floss
of mane and tail had also flecks of gold
towards the ends, like those in the locks of
some dark-haired women. Like her great-granddam,
Fleur-de-Lis, she stood full sixteen
hands, but was neither leggy nor light
of bone.</p>

<p>“May I give her an apple?” said Virginia,
as she turned her slow, dark look
from Bonnibel to her master. That sagacious
damosel was already reaching after
the coveted golden ball in the girl’s hand,
with cajoling little movements of her soft
nose. Having obtained permission, Miss
Herrick threw one arm over the mare’s
graceful crest and presented her with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
apple&mdash;one of those renowned Albemarle
pippins on which no duty is demanded by
England’s gracious queen.</p>

<p>Bonnibel ate it with evident participation
in her sovereign’s good taste, rubbing her
handsome head against the girl’s arm with
an almost cat-like softness of caress.</p>

<p>“I don’ s’pose any one ever rides her but
you?” said Virginia, with a suggestion of
wistfulness in her low voice.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” said Roden; “only the lad
who gives her her gallops. She is as kind
as a kitten, but rather hot-headed and excitable.
Why do you ask? Would you
like to ride her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of co’se I would,” said the girl,
calmly; “but you needn’t bother; I know
how Englishmen are ’bout their horses.
Some time, if the boy as rides her gets sick,
if you’ll let me I’ll show you whether I kin
ride or no.”</p>

<p>“Your father says you ride like an Indian,”
said Roden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>She moved her shoulders beneath her
loose gray jacket with something very like
a shrug. “I don’t bleeve father ever saw
a Injun in his life,” she remarked. “You
wait; I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt you have a good seat,”
said Roden, pleasantly; he took particular
pains to speak pleasantly always to Herrick
and his daughter. “But the chief
thing with a horse like Bonnibel is the
hands. How are you about that?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” she said, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, have you nice light hands? Are
you gentle in handling your mount?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, with the comprehensive
indrawing of the breath which he was beginning
to recognize as one of her chief
characteristics. “You mean am I kind
about yerkin’ ’em. Well, I’ll tell you: I
never pulled any rougher on a horse’s
mouth in my life than I’d like anybody to
pull on mine.”</p>

<p>“I wish some of my friends would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that for their motto,” said Roden. “I’m
thinking I’ll let you ride Bonnibel some
time, if <em>she</em> will.” He ended with a smile.</p>

<p>It was not more than a week afterwards
that he had occasion to require Virginia’s
services. One of the other horses, a rank,
irritable brute, called Usurper, had jammed
Roden’s shoulder quite severely against the
side of the box, and Bonnibel’s own especial
groom had been sent back to New
York to bring on two new-comers but just
arrived from England.</p>

<p>“I don’t think she’ll stand a riding-skirt,”
he said, rather doubtfully, as the beautiful
beast was led out, reaching after the reins
with her supple neck.</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to ride her with one,” said
Virginia.</p>

<p>He then saw that Bonnibel was saddled
with a man’s saddle, and the next moment
the girl was astride of the mare, the reins
gathered skilfully into her long brown fingers,
head erect, and hands well down&mdash;lithe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
beautiful with the beauty of some
sunburnt, mountain-bred boy.</p>

<p>As Bonnibel felt the strange touch upon
her mouth she wheeled, rearing a little,
and the girl’s soft hat was shaken from her
head. Roden wondered if he had ever
seen anything prettier than the sunlight on
the young Virginian’s sun-like curls, and
the glossy hide of Bonnibel.</p>

<p>The mare was going quieter now, mincing
along and picking up her feet after a
fashion much in vogue among equine coquettes.
She was beginning to like the
feel of the light, firm hands, and to be
sensible of the masterly pressure of the
strong young knees upon her mighty shoulders.</p>

<p>“By Jove! what a graceful seat the little
witch has got!” Roden said to himself
with sufficient admiration. “And hands as
steady as an old stager!&mdash;Gad!” This exclamation,
breaking forth at first from an
impulse of terror, ended in the relieved announcement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
“That was fine; as I live it
was!”</p>

<p>Bonnibel had bolted, going straight for
a snake-fence at the bottom of the hill on
which the stables were builded. To stop
her was, he knew, impossible; to turn her
aside on the slippery turf, more unreliable
than usual with the spring rains, would
have been culpably perilous. The fence
just here was fortunately not very high,
but Bonnibel had one serious fault. When
excited, she had a way of going at her
fences head down, after a fashion calculated
to break her own neck, and certainly
that of the person who rode her. He saw
the girl sit well down in the saddle, run the
bit through the mare’s mouth, and bring
her head up, showing her the leap in front
with a skill he could not himself have
rivalled; and Roden was no tyro. Bonnibel
cleared the rails in gallant form, and
Virginia then took her for a canter around
the field beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>She came up to Roden, ten minutes
later, with flushed cheeks and her great
eyes brilliant.</p>

<p>“If she had a-hurt herself then,” she
said, flinging herself tempestuously to the
ground, “I’d ’a’ got one o’ th’ grooms to
kill me.” She turned and showered the
mare’s sleek crest with kisses, then tossed
the reins to Roden, and ran swiftly out of
sight towards the house. He thought her
the strangest creature he had ever seen.</p>

<p>In the mean time the days wore on.
Roden was more than pleased with his Virginian
venture. He had three excellent
stables building, his gees were all in first-rate
condition, and his prospect for the provincial
races more than fair.</p>

<p>Virginia now rode Bonnibel every day.
There sprung up between the two, mare
and woman, one of those mutual attachments
as rare in reality as they are common
in fiction. Virginia could catch the
nervous beast when it meant danger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
others to come within reach of her iron-shod
heels. Virginia seemed to murmur
a strange language into her slender ears,
as certain in its effects as the whisper of
the Roumanians to their horses. For Virginia
would Bonnibel become as a spring
lamb for meekness, or one of her own
mountain-streams for impetuosity. It afforded
Roden a strange pleasure to watch
the relations which existed between this
beautiful savage maiden and his beautiful
savage mare.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he found the girl
more than useful to him. She knew all
the owners of good horse-flesh in the surrounding
counties. She explored strange
woods with him, while it came to be an understood
thing that every day she should
go with him on his long tramps. She
marched sturdily at his side through brake
and brier. She had no skirts to tear, no
under-draperies of lace to draggle. She
was always good-tempered and never tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one day about the middle of
March that they stood together on a windblown
hill-side. A dark-blue sky gleamed
overhead, set thickly with clouds of a vivid,
opaque white, like the figures on antique
Etruscan ware. The chain of distant hills
clasped the tawny winter earth, as a violet
ribbon might clasp the dusky body of an
Eastern slave. So like was the pale horizon
to a sunlit sea that the white gleam
of a wood-dove’s wing across it suggested
instantly to them both the idea of a
sail.</p>

<p>There was a sound, now far, now near,
vague, intermittent, made by the rushing
of the wind through the dry grass in the
fields. The forlorn discord of the voices
of spring lambs reached their ears, together
with the reassuring monotone of the ewes.
A sudden commotion among the flock
caused Virginia to run suddenly forward,
shading her eyes with her hand.</p>

<p>“It’s that narsty Erroll dorg again!” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
said, wrathfully. “He’ll jess run those
sheep to death.”</p>

<p>“What dog?” said Roden, coming up
beside her. “By Jove! it’s a German
sleuth-hound,” he added. “I’m afraid he’ll
play the deuce with your father’s sheep,
Miss Virginia.”</p>

<p>“He will so, ef he ain’t stopped,” she
said, gloomily. “I didn’t know the Errolls
had come back to Windemere. Plague
gone him! Look there, now!”</p>

<p>Just here came the shrill sound of a dog-whistle,
then a clear voice calling, “Laurin!
Laurin! Laurin, I say!”</p>

<p>They saw a girl on a chestnut horse,
galloping towards the terrified, bleating
sheep. She gained upon the great hound,
came up with him, swung from her saddle,
and caught him by the collar. After a moment
or two she began to walk towards
them through the weeds and brambles
which overgrew the hill-side. As she
came nearer they could see that she held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a lamb beneath one arm. A tall, slight girl
in a dark habit, with dark curls escaping
about her forehead from her very correct
pot hat. The hound followed meekly. “I
am so very, very sorry,” she called out,
while yet some distance off. “I am afraid
my dog has hurt this poor little thing.”
As she came closer Roden saw that there
was blood on the lamb, and on the dog’s
dripping jaws.</p>

<p>“Please look at it,” the girl said, wofully.
“I’m afraid nothing will ever break him.
He will have to be sent away. They are
your father’s sheep, aren’t they, Miss Herrick&mdash;you
are Miss Herrick?”</p>

<p>Virginia lifted her full look to the
stranger’s face. “Yes, that’s my name,”
she answered. “Why don’t you muzzle
him, or keep him chained? He’ll get shot
some day.”</p>

<p>The girl looked sadly down at her huge
pet. “I’m afraid he will,” she said, gently.
“I wish he wouldn’t do it. I can’t feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
same to him. Ah, you beast!”&mdash;this last to
the recreant Laurin, in a tone of wrath. In
the mean time Roden had finished his examination
of the lamb.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s serious,” he said, kindly;
“but it will have to be looked after a
bit. Miss Herrick here will doctor it successfully,
I’ve no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t I have it?” said the girl,
eagerly. “I’m such a good hand at curing
things. Do let me have it, Miss Herrick.”</p>

<p>“Take it if you want it,” said Virginia.</p>

<p>“But cannot you have it sent?” said
Roden, as the girl held out her hand for
the lamb. “I am afraid you will get blood
all over your habit, Miss&mdash;” He had not
meant to fish for her name, and stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a soft smiling
of lips and eyes. “My name is Erroll&mdash;Mary
Erroll,” she said. “And thank you,
I would rather take it. Laurin will follow
me now. <em>Ah</em>, you beast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will have to put it down until
you mount,” said Roden, laughing a little
in spite of himself, as the old lines about
Mary and her little lamb crossed his mind.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I wouldn’t put it down,” she
said, hastily. “Miss Herrick will hold it for
me, won’t you?&mdash;and if you would be so
kind as to mount me, Mr. Roden.”</p>

<p>“You know my name?” said Roden, as
he took the slight foot, arched like Bonnibel’s
crest, into his hand.</p>

<p>“Why, who in the neighborhood does
not?” she said, settling herself in the saddle.
“Not to know you would be to argue
one’s self very much unknown in this
neighborhood. Now give me the lamb.
Thank you so much. Come, Laurin. Good-by,
Miss Herrick.” She placed the lamb
carefully against her side, whistled to the
hound, and started off at a round trot. Her
figure, in its trim Quorn-cloth habit, came
into bold relief against the vivid sky. He
watched admiringly the long supple waist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as it swayed to the motion of the horse, the
bold graceful sweep of the shoulders, and
high carriage of the small head. He had
read so much concerning the gathers and
gilt braid of the Virginian horsewoman
that it struck him as something entirely
strange, the fact that Miss Mary Erroll
should wear a neat, well-cut habit, and a
chimney-pot hat. He also recalled that
her saddle was all that it should be, and
that instead of the gold-and-ivory-handled
cutting whip which he had been led to expect,
she carried a light but sturdy crop.</p>

<p>“By Jove! how she rides!” he said to
himself.</p>

<p>“Don’t I ride as well?” came the soft
monotone of Virginia at his ear.</p>

<p>He answered her, still with his eyes on
the vanishing figure of the girl in the
Quorn-cloth habit. “You ride like an
Arab,” he said. “She rides like&mdash;like&mdash;like
an Englishwoman.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I ride as well,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Virginia, in an indescribable voice, turning
away. She was filled with an unreasoning,
unchristian, wholly uncivilized desire to
mount Bonnibel, overtake, and spatter Miss
Mary Erroll with as much mud as possible.
Suddenly she turned and came back to
Roden. “I&mdash;I&mdash;I s’pose you think a gyrl
oughtn’ to ride straddle?” she said, with
an unusual hint of timidity in her rich
tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that there’s any harm
in it,” he said, carelessly. Again she stood
away from him. A feeling of utterly unreasonable
anger and rebellion was swelling in
her heart and straining her throat. Was
it against Miss Mary Erroll or against
Roden? She could not herself have told.
One fact was entirely apparent to her: he
did not deem what she did or did not do
things worthy his consideration.</p>

<p>“I bet she couldn’t ride Bonnibel!” she
said, passionately, between her locked teeth,
as she went blindly on through the furze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and briers. “I bet she couldn’t ride Bonnibel&mdash;straddle
or no straddle!”</p>

<p>It was not until three days later that
she found out from her father the fact of
Roden’s having been to call (nominally)
upon the lamb of Miss Mary Erroll.</p>

<p>“The beauty of the question air,” ended
that modern Solomon, as he filled his white
clay pipe&mdash;“The beauty of the question
air, that thar gyrl cert’n’y is goin’ to lead
that young fellar a darnce. They say she’s
got it down ter a fine p’int.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Virginia, curtly.</p>

<p>“Why, coquettin’&mdash;hyah! hyah! <em>That’s</em>
the darnce she’ll lead <em>him</em>. ’N’ they sez,
moresomever, as how th’ English fellars
takes to her like the partridges ter th’
woods&mdash;plague ’em!&mdash;’count o’ her w’arin’
boots like a man, an’ skirts at harf-marst
when she goes out on hawseback. Lawd!
I cert’n’y do ’spise ter see a woman hitched
onter th’ side uv er hawse like a pecker-wood
a-stickin’ ter rer tree-trunk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia came and leaned on the back
of his chair, picking some bits of straw
from his many-hued waistcoat. “You don’t
think it’s any harm for a girl to ride straddle,
do you, father?” she said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Harm!” said old Herrick, twisting about
in his chair to look up at her&mdash;“<em>harm!</em>” He
set his pipe firmly between his teeth, and
pushed out his underlip with an expression of
entire scorn. “Is there any harm in a hoppergrass
hoppin’?” he questioned. “G’long!
don’ talk none o’ yo’ nonsense ter me!”</p>

<p>This, however, did not entirely satisfy
her on the question in point.</p>

<p>Roden was not a little astonished to meet
her, as she returned from giving Bonnibel
her morning gallop, in a very fair imitation
of Miss Mary Erroll’s habit, and an old pot
hat that had evidently belonged to some
one of the previous Englishmen.</p>

<p>“Why, what a swell you are!” he said,
pleasantly, joining her. “But how does
Bonnibel like the change?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“It don’t make any diff’r’nce how she
likes it,” said Miss Herrick, curtly, adding
hastily, with a swift change of manner,
“She r’ared once or twice at first, but
that’s all.” Then she stopped suddenly, and
stepped around in front of him. “How&mdash;how
does it look&mdash;really?” she said, with a
shamefaced and comprehensive downward
glance at her skirt.</p>

<p>“It looks awfully well,” Roden assured
her&mdash;“awfully well. How tall and strong
you are, Miss Virginia!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a right good mustle,” she said,
showing her handsome teeth in one of her
rare and vivid smiles. “Mornin’: I’ve got
a heap to do.”</p>

<p>Roden watched her as she stalked away
with her splendid swinging stride, thinking
vaguely of her beauty and its absolute waste
in her position. “She’ll marry some ‘po’
white’ who talks as much like a nigger as
her own father,” he thought, half regretfully;
“have a lot of children, and end by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
smoking a pipe&mdash;ugh!” He then went to
call, for the third time that week, upon Mary
Erroll. The visit ended by their going for
a ride, and just as they neared the gates of
Caryston a smart shower came pelting down
the eastern slope of Peter’s Mountain.</p>

<p>“Do come in and wait until this is over,”
he said, urgently, bending from his horse
to open the long gray gate, which was now
proudly supported on strong hinges. “Miss
Herrick will chaperon us.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I’ll come,” she said,
amazed, in her Southern freedom, that he
should pause to question the propriety of
her so doing. At one o’clock in the day,
and with her little darky henchman mounting
guard, what possible objection could
any one find? She ran up the stone steps
with a pretty clattering of her boots, and
Roden threw wide the doors of the great
hall. She was delighted with everything;
got on a chair to examine the great moose-head;
struck some chords on an old harp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that she discovered in a dark corner; made
friends with the collie and one of the Persian
cats, who came purring up from the
recess of a distant window; looked over
his collection of curious weapons; and on
finding that he had spent some years of his
life in Mexico, questioned him about his experiences
there with a pretty assumption of
almost motherly interest.</p>

<p>“Can’t you say some&mdash;some Mexican?”
she said. “I should so like to hear it.”</p>

<p>“I love you, most beautiful of maidens,”
said Roden, lazily, in the Mexican patois.</p>

<p>“What does that mean? It sounds enchanting.”</p>

<p>“It means enchantment.”</p>

<p>She leaned suddenly forward and looked
at him with her bright, soft, childishly chaste
eyes. “Mr. Roden,” she said, sweetly, “if I
were not very sure you were only laughing,
I should accuse you of trying to ensnare
my simple country soul with a spurious
sentimentality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Roden roused himself from his lounging
position in one of the big hall chairs with
a jerk. An expression half of amusement,
half of guilt, crossed his handsome sunburnt
face. “You are very unjust,” he
said. “I am certainly not laughing, and I
couldn’t be sentimental if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” she said, with her pretty
Southern accent. “How very, how rudely
unflattering!”</p>

<p>“I meant I would not have to try to be
so&mdash;with you,” said Roden, dexterously
mendacious.</p>

<p>“How very, how rudely untruthful!”</p>

<p>They were here told by Popocatepetl that
“lunch dun rade-y.”</p>

<p>Roden’s meals were generally presided
over by Virginia, and she came forward to
meet him now with a little silver dish of
apples in one hand, evidently utterly ignorant
of the presence of Mary Erroll. She
stopped short, half-way across the room. A
shadow as definite and sombre as the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from a brilliant cloud upon a laughing
grass-field in May settled over her face.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to fix another place,” she said,
curtly, and turned her back upon them in
order to do so.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll expressed herself charmed
with her luncheon. She ate bread and
honey with all the gusto of the queen of
nursery lore, taking off her riding-gloves
and showing long, flower-like hands, that
were reflected as whitely in the polished
mahogany of the round table as the pale
primroses which adorned its centre.</p>

<p>Virginia moved about noiselessly. All
at once she stopped beside Roden, and put
one hand heavily on the back of his chair.
He looked up in some surprise. Her eyes
were flashing under her bent brows, like
the “brush fires” of her native State under
a night horizon.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait on <em>you</em>,” she said, in a smothered
voice&mdash;“I say I’ll wait on <em>you</em>, <em>but I
won’t wait on her</em>.” She dashed down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
napkin, which she had lifted from the floor,
and strode with her swift, noiseless movements
to the door.</p>

<p>“Virginia!” said Roden, aghast&mdash;“Virginia!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” cried the girl, passionately,
swinging open the heavy door&mdash;“I don’t
care! I ain’t anybody’s nigger!”</p>

<p>She rushed out tempestuously, dragging
from one or two rings the heavy portière,
which with a native incongruity hung before
the door itself.</p>

<p>“How vulgarity will crop out!” said Roden,
rising to shut the door. “That poor
little girl has behaved so well until to-day!”</p>

<p>That evening, as he sat writing in a little
room opening into the dining-room, Virginia
entered, and came and stood beside
him. He did not look up. She had annoyed
him a good deal, and he was not
prepared to yield the forgiveness for which
he felt she had come to plead. She stood
there some moments quite silent, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
reached over his shoulder and dropped
something on the table before him.</p>

<p>“You said th’ other day you wanted one
for the silver. There ’tis,” she said. She
turned before he could speak, and left the
room.</p>

<p>Lifting the crimson mass from the table,
he saw that it was an old-fashioned purse
of netted silk, secured by little steel rings.
He recalled a speech which he had made a
day or two ago concerning the inconvenience
of modern purses as regarded silver
currency. He started up and opened the
door, calling the girl by name two or three
times. No one answered, and he went
down the hall and into Herrick’s room.</p>

<p>The overseer was there, whittling something
by the light of a smoking kerosene
lamp. Aunt Tishy was there, grumbling
to herself about “folks cuttin’ trash all
over de flo’ fur her ter break her pore ole
back over.” The raccoon was very much
there, as he seemed to be having a fit just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as Roden entered. But there was no Virginia.
Her spinning-wheel stood idle in
its corner; her heavy boots were drying in
front of the wood fire; there was a book,
face down, upon the deal table&mdash;a book
which she must have been reading, as no
one else at Caryston besides Roden ever
glanced between the covers of one.</p>

<p>He lifted it, expecting to find some Dora-Thornesque
romance of high life. It was a
condensed copy of “Youatt on the Horse,”
and beneath it was a racing calendar for
’79. Alas! alas! even this discovery told
nothing else to this otherwise discerning
young man. He smiled as he put down
the volumes, thinking that the little Virginian
was bent on making him acknowledge
her a superior horsewoman in all respects.</p>

<p>He then inquired of Herrick as to the
whereabouts of Virginia. Neither the girl’s
father nor Aunt Tishy could tell him.</p>

<p>“If you’ll lend me a pencil I’ll just leave
a note for her,” he said, feeling instinctively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that she would not care to have a message
in regard to her little gift left with her father
or the old negress.</p>

<p>He scribbled a few words on one of the
fly-leaves of the racing calendar, tore it out,
folded it securely, and handed it to Herrick.</p>

<p>“Please give that to your daughter when
she comes back,” he said. “Good-night,”
and left the room.</p>

<p>Old Herrick waited until he heard the
distant clang of the dining-room door; then
he settled his spectacles very carefully
upon his large nose, pushed out his underlip,
and unfolding the little note, thrust it
almost into the flame of the lamp while
reading it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Faginia</span>’ (Humph!),&mdash;Many
thanks fur yo’ beeyeutiful purse.
I will alluz keep hit. Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">J. Roden</span>.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated Herrick again&mdash;“humph!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>He set one long, knotty hand back down
against his side, and turned the bit of paper
about scornfully between the thumb and
forefinger of his other hand, regarding it
the while over his spectacles. “Humph!”
he said for the fourth time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IV">IV.</h2>

<p>It was one o’clock on that same night
Virginia Herrick leaned with round bare
arms on the table, above which hung a little
oblong, old-fashioned mirror in a warped
mahogany frame. The one candle on a
little bracket at her right hand, brought out
the clear tones in her face and throat and
arms, and dived vividly into her masses of
loosened hair; beyond her was a background
of vague shadows; she looked from
the tarnished mirror like a painting from
its frame. Her eyes were sombre and
heavy under their dark lids. The light
falling down upon her sent long delicate
shadows trembling upon her cheeks&mdash;shadows
such as are made by the bending of
summer grasses across a woman’s white
gown, and which in Virginia’s case were
cast by her thick, curled lashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>She had taken off the waist of her homespun
dress, and the folds of her much-gathered
chemise assumed a silvery tone in the
concentrated light. The contrast between
the dead white of the stuff and the living
white of her neck and arms was as perfect
as when Southern peach-trees, blossoming
before their time, are seen next day against
vast fields of snow.</p>

<p>One of the Persian cats leaped with soft
agility upon the table, and passed purring
between the girl and her fair image in the
dingy glass; she swept him from her way
with one sure motion of her strong bare
arm, and returned to her intent scrutiny of
her own face.</p>

<p>The time passed on. A rat began an
intermittent nibbling in the old wainscoting
of the room; sharp, sudden noises were
heard overhead; the fire died out in tinkling
silence; a heavy shroud of semi-transparent
tallow wrapped the one candle.
Two o’clock had sounded through the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
depths of the old house some time ago.
Suddenly she spoke. “I wisht I knew ef
I war pretty,” she said. Then, with passionate
reiterance, “I <em>wisht</em> I knew ef I
war pretty.”</p>

<p>The cat, hearing her voice, leaped again
beside her, as if to answer; again she swept
him to the floor. The soft, cushioned thud
of his feet against the bare boards sounded
quite distinctly upon the silence, so alert to
catch every noise. “Oh, I wisht&mdash;I <em>wisht</em> I
knew ef I war pretty,” she said once more.</p>

<p>Poor little savage, you are pretty indeed&mdash;with
a prettiness which civilization
would give many of its privileges to possess.
So, I doubt not, were fashioned the
wood-nymphs of old, with strength and
with health and with grace beyond all
power of reproduction&mdash;even so have they
gazed deep into their woodland lakes; and
the lakes, did they not answer? Who but
Beauty was ever mother of such curves
and tints?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>This time she put another question. “I
wisht I knew ef&mdash;it&mdash;pleased&mdash;<em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>She had yielded up her secret to the old
mirror, and to Hafiz&mdash;what better confidants?
The one had no tongue; the other
a tongue used only for lapping unlimited
supplies of Alderney cream.</p>

<p>With a sudden movement she leaned
forward and blew out the sputtering candle.
She did not wish even her own eyes
in the mirror to pry upon her.</p>

<p>Three days later Roden and Usurper
figured in a hurdle race of some note in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This Usurper was by King Tom, out of
Uarda, and as rank a brute as ever went
headlong at his hurdle, often taking off
nearly a length too soon. Virginia, who
had seen him day after day at his work,
ventured timidly to suggest to Roden that
one of the lads should ride the horse. He
laughed, and told her he had thought her
above that very ordinary failing of women&mdash;nervousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
She said nothing more,
turning short on her heel with the customary
dissenting movement of her fine
shoulders.</p>

<p>These races were to be quite a swell affair,
and there were a good many carriages
outside of the course. Miss Erroll and her
mother, sunk deep in an old-fashioned landau,
talked to Roden as he leaned on the
side of the carriage, very brown and gallant
in his racing-togs.</p>

<p>Virginia was seated on Pokeberry, not
three yards off. She watched curiously
each movement of Miss Erroll, dwelling
with strained, wondering eyes upon her
pretty wrinkled gloves; her close-fitting
corsage of white serge; her little dark-red
velvet toque; her parasol, a vivid arrangement
of cream-color and red, which made a
charming plaque-like background for her
fair face; she also noticed the posy of blue
and white flowers which was pinned on the
left side against the white bodice of Miss Erroll.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Roden’s colors were blue and white.
Virginia herself had a little knot of white
and blue hyacinths on her riding-habit;
she jerked them out with a savage movement,
tossed them on the ground, and carefully
guided the hoofs of Pokeberry upon
them.</p>

<p>All unconscious was she that in her eyes,
blue now with anger, and her cheeks so
white with pain, she wore his colors whether
she would or not.</p>

<p>There were two races before the one in
which he rode. Then he went off to be
weighed, and Virginia dismounted from
Pokeberry, and gave a little nigger a cent
or two to hold the mare.</p>

<p>She went and leaned against the railing,
waiting for the start. All went well enough
until the finish. Roden came sweeping
down the homestretch in an easy canter,
Usurper well in hand and going game as
a pebble, and one more hurdle to jump.</p>

<p>Virginia held her breath; she had a horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
certainty that Usurper would refuse
that last hurdle, or do something equally
idiotic. Roden sent him at it in fine form.
There was a second of expectancy, a smart
crash, and then Usurper, scrambling heavily
to his feet, tore off down the course, leaving
a mass of blue and white half under the
débris of the hurdle. The brute had not
risen an inch, and had flung Roden headfirst
into the hurdle, himself turning a complete
somersault.</p>

<p>On came the other horses, ten of them,
in full gallop. Mary Erroll stood on her
feet, with a little broken cry. Some men,
until now paralyzed with astonishment and
horror, started forward; but swifter than
all, unhesitating, strong of arm as of nerve,
Herrick’s daughter, diving beneath the rail,
rushed out into the middle of the track, and
seizing the senseless man beneath his arms
dragged him by main force out of the way
of the coming horses. The hoof of one of
them, however, struck her on her left shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
taking a good bit of flesh and cloth
clean away as though with a knife.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of blood about
Roden’s head&mdash;some at first thought that
he was seriously injured. They carried
him into a tent and sent for a surgeon. In
an hour he was all right, however, and
wrote a few words upon some little ivory
tablets, sent him by Miss Erroll for that
purpose, to assure her of his entire recovery.
Mary then sent to ask if Miss Herrick
would not be so very kind as to come
and speak to her. The girl came, sullenly
enough, touching from time to time the
bandages about her left shoulder, as though
restless under even so slight a restraint.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you so very, very
much,” said Mary, in her sweetest voice.
She leaned far out of the landau and held
out her hand to Virginia.</p>

<p>“What a’ <em>you</em> thankin’ me fur?” demanded
the girl, fiercely, stepping backward from
the extended hand. “<em>You</em> ain’t got nothin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to thank me fur&mdash;have you?” she ended,
with a sudden change from aggressiveness
to appeal infinitely pathetic.</p>

<p>A swift red had dyed Mary’s face at the
first reception of her kindly meant advances.
It faded out now, leaving her very pale.</p>

<p>“Every one who is a friend of Mr. Roden
ought to thank you, if they do not,” she
said, with great dignity. “I am sorry I
spoke, since it has been so disagreeable to
you. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>Virginia was dismissed&mdash;she felt it. The
knowledge went scorching through her
veins as kirsch through the veins of one
not accustomed to its fire. She hated the
girl with a mad, barbaric impulse, which
was as much beyond her control as its tides
are beyond the control of the ocean; she
felt an animosity to Miss Erroll’s very hat,
to her pretty parasol with its bunch of red
velvet ribbons on the bamboo handle. She
would have liked to seize and tear them to
pieces, as a humming-bird tears the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
which has refused its honey. A red mist
rose to her eyes. The Erroll carriage and
its occupants seemed to be melting away
and away in a golden haze. She stepped
backward, keeping her eyes on it, as a fascinated
bird looks ever on the serpent that
has charmed it.</p>

<p>“I hate her&mdash;I hate her&mdash;I hate her,”
she said, back of her teeth, not fiercely, as
she had at first spoken, but with a dull assertiveness.</p>

<p>She refused several offers from kindly
neighbors who would have driven her
home. She could ride quite well, she said,
without using her left arm.</p>

<p>The evening was lowering and purple
towards the north-east, full of vague shadows
and noises of homeward creatures.
The west was aglare as with floating golden
ribbons from some mighty, unseen Maypole
behind the luridly dark mountains.</p>

<p>The slanting light touched the crests of
the clods in a newly ploughed field to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
left with a vivid effect, remindful of the
light-capped wavelets on an evening bay.
Farther on it was long, glistening stalks of
fodder which caught the level gleaming
from the west, as might the rifles of a regiment
that has been ordered to fire lying
down. The fresh green hollows of the hills
were full of a palpable golden ether, like
cups of emerald brimmed with the lucent
amber drink of other days.</p>

<p>A leather-winged bat brushed against
her cheek, flying heavily into some broom-straw
just beyond. She saw nothing, felt
nothing, heard nothing beyond the dark
hours ahead of her, the heavy aching of
her heart, and its loud monotonous beating,
to which she unconsciously set words as
one does to the iterant chatter of a clock.</p>

<p>“Yes, he loves her&mdash;yes, he loves her,”
so it seemed to say, over and over, again
and again. Almost she could have torn it
from her breast and flung it from her, had
not it been sacred to her for the love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
him with which it was filled. Think of it;
try to imagine it. A woman fully developed,
heart and body full of the South from
bright head to nimble feet, as the South is
full of beauty; free as the birds that cleaved
her native air with strong, untiring wings;
unlearned in all emotion whether of love or
of hate; not weary in sense or perception;
untutored, unknowing, uncivilized&mdash;and loving
for the first time in all her one-and-twenty
years of living!</p>

<p>There was no analysis here, no picking
to pieces of little emotions, no skewering
of butterfly passions to sheets of paper
from the book of former knowledge. No
comparison between then and now&mdash;between
now and what might possibly have
been had the bits of glass in the kaleidoscope
of existence assumed a certain difference
of juxtaposition. She loved him.
Why she loved him, how she loved him,
she could no more have told you than she
could have told the names of the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
elements which composed the tears with
which her hot eyes brimmed.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock of that same evening.
Roden, restless and feverish, flung
from side to side on an old leathern sofa
in the library. There were no candles, but
a great fire of chestnut-wood sought and
found all such points as were capable of
illumination in the sombre old room&mdash;the
brass claw feet of the tables and chairs, the
great brass hinges of the rosewood bookcase,
the glass knobs on an old writing-desk
in one corner, Roden’s eyes and hair as he
lay listlessly resigned for a moment or two
staring into the noisy labyrinths of the
flames.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later. The leaping
flames had settled as in sleep upon a bed
of red-gold coals; a little ever-ascending
spiral of gray-white smoke escaped from
a cleft in the end of one of the half-burned
logs. The old chimney-place was like a
vivid picture set in the dark wall. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
yawning black throat, heavily clogged with
soot, was tinged faintly for some way up
by the glow from the lurid mass on the
hearth. The great iron fire-dogs, at least
four feet in height, were connected from
shaft to shaft by a chain in grotesque suggestion
of the Siamese twins. The much-burnt
bricks had assumed opaline tones,
in rosy grays and greenish-yellows, beneath
the intense heat and light. On the hearth-rug
the collie lay stretched, his ruffled legs
every now and then executing an unavailing
canter, as in his dreams perchance he
chased a soaring buzzard.</p>

<p>They were all three asleep&mdash;the fire, the
collie, Roden. A soft crooning wind, conducive
to slumber, sighed at the doors and
windows, vibrating every once in a while
with sonorous minor cadences.</p>

<p>Suddenly the incessant monotone was
snapped, as it were, to silence. The door
leading into the library had been opened;
some one entered cautiously, stood still;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
then the door was again closed noiselessly.</p>

<p>The person who had entered crept forward
a pace or two. It was Virginia.
She had not yet taken off her riding-habit,
and the bandages were yet about her shoulder.
Some dark stains here and there told
where the blood had soaked through. As
she came forward, nearer to the rich lambency
of the fire, her white face borrowed
some of its roseate flush, but the lines of
pain, mental and physical, were traced as
with a fine chisel about the sombre mouth
and eyes. Stealing past the foot of the
sofa on which Roden lay, she stood a moment
looking at him. Her crossed wrists
pressed each other hard against her bosom,
her long fingers drawing the stuff of her
habit in wrinkles with the tenseness of
their grasp upon it. Her breast rose and
fell, impatient, eager, behind the close prison
of her arms, as some woodland thing so
held might seek to be free. All at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
she sank down to her knees upon the
hearth-rug, lifting both hands to her bent
face, and rocking herself to and fro with
wild, swaying movements of her supple
body. The collie raised his head with a
drowsy curiosity, and let it fall heavily
again upon the floor. The varying monody
of the wind had begun again through
the chinks in the closed door.</p>

<p>At last she lifted her head, letting her
clasped hands fall loosely into her lap. A
sudden flame showed her with an added
vividness the face of Roden as he lay in
tired unconsciousness upon the old lounge.
She moved nearer to him, still on her
knees; then again lifting her hands to her
bosom, leaned forward and gazed upon
him as though one should drink with the
eyes. Her great braids, ruffled and half
unplaited, followed the lithe curves of her
back with glittering undulations, as of two
mated golden serpents. So passed some
moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently, as though uneasy, even in the
far-off Land of Nod, beneath those moveless,
hungry, beautiful eyes, the young man
stirred, and muttered something in his
sleep. Swift and noiseless as a cat she
leaped backward into the folded shadows;
but he did not wake. Once more she
came forward. With a stealthy movement
she drew out a little pair of scissors from
the bosom of her dress; then bending over,
lifted, with the touch of a butterfly upon
a flower, one of Roden’s much-tossed curls.
There was the sharp hiss of steel through
hair, and the soft brown semicircle lay in
the girl’s palm. She lifted it to her lips
with the gesture of one who, half starved,
suddenly finds bread within his grasp;
then turning, she stole out again, even as
she had entered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="V">V.</h2>

<p>Roden was not able to leave the house
for many days. During this time Virginia
waited upon him, sang to him, brought
into service her every power of amusement.</p>

<p>She coaxed her perverse “mammy” to
teach her new darky songs by reading endless
chapters in the Bible. All her spare
time was spent in setting them to appropriate
accompaniments. She would sit and
recount absurd anecdotes to him by the
hour in her slow, sweet monotone, as unsuggestive
of anything humorous as can
well be imagined. Sometimes she fetched
her spinning-wheel and spun as she talked.
He felt vexed with himself that he could
not sketch her as she sat plying the dull
blue thread with her nimble fingers. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
homespun dress dropped naturally into
those broad, generous folds beloved of
sculptors. She had a clear, placid profile,
which always found shadows sufficiently
willing to serve as background for its pale
beauty. Her head was noble in its contours,
and as graceful in its startled, listening
movements as that of a stag. Roden
did make several attempts to fix her upon
paper, but ended always with a contemptuous
exclamation and a hurried, clever drawing
of a steeple-chase, or Bonnibel, or some
other equally horsy subject.</p>

<p>One day he happened to mention that as
a lad he had played tolerably well on the
violin. Virginia rose at once, saying that
she thought there was one in the attic.</p>

<p>She took a candle, and went up the little
corkscrew staircase that led into the roof
of the house&mdash;a dark, dusty, cavernous
place, smelling of mould and old books.
There were many hair-covered trunks studded
with brass nails, heaps of old saddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and harness, fire-dogs, brass and iron, a disused
loom.</p>

<p>The corners of the room were veiled in
a thick and rustling obscurity, suggestive
of parchment and rats. Onions and red
peppers adorned the ceiling.</p>

<p>Virginia set down the candle on one of
the moth-eaten trunks, and lifted the lid of
a second.</p>

<p>A fine cloud of little white particles flew
out into her face, as impalpable, as easy of
escape, as impossible to recapture, as the
contents of Pandora’s box. The girl thrust
in her long brown arm, and drew out a
bunch of white ostrich feathers.</p>

<p>They were shedding their delicate moth-nibbled
filaments like snow upon her dark
gown and the bare floor of the attic. She
drew them caressingly through her fingers
as though in pity; it seemed to her sad
that things so charming should have so
common a fate. She then stooped, and
after a little searching drew out the violin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>She was about to shut down the lid of
the trunk when something caught her eye&mdash;a
bunch of cherry-colored ribbon, which
burst from beneath a mass of moth-eaten
gray fur, like a sudden flame from covering
ashes.</p>

<p>She reached down and pulled it out;
but lo! it was not only a knot of ribbons;
something more followed&mdash;a sleeve of heavy
antique silk, stiffly brocaded in red and gold
flowers on a cream-hued ground. Then
came more ribbons, a mass of fine lace, a
scarlet petticoat. The girl put down the
violin, held up this relic of the Old Dominion,
and shook it out somewhat contemptuously.
A little parcel fell from the musty
skirt&mdash;a pair of slippers with high red heels
and little red rosettes. As she looked, a
sudden change came over the girl’s face, a
sudden flash of resolve, a quick suffusion
of bright color. She seized the little shoes,
bundled them again into the dress, and
drew her own homespun skirt over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
whole. Then, tucking the violin under her
arm and lifting the candle, she ran at a perilously
hurried pace down the contorted
stair-way and into her own room.</p>

<p>She closed and locked the door, laid the
dress and violin on the bed, and still standing
up, pulled and tugged at one of her
heavy shoes until it came off in her hand,
discovering one of her shapely feet in its
blue yarn stocking. But, alas! Virginia
present could not get her foot into the
slipper of Virginia past. She sat down on
the edge of the bed in mortified vanquishment,
and turned the pretty, absurd thing
about in her strong hand. Then once more
she tried to put it on. She found that by
squeezing her toes into the toe of the slipper
she could manage to walk, as there was
no restraint at the back of the foot. She
then lifted and put on the dress. It would
not meet by several inches about her splendid
young bosom, and the waist gaped at
her derisively from the little mahogany-framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mirror. She was, however, determined.
She hid these defects as best she
might, by snipping away bunches of the
cherry-colored ribbon here and there, and
pinning them in reckless profusion above
the gap in the bodice. My lady of the
time of George the Third must have been
shorter than this damsel of the first year of
President Cleveland’s administration. The
stiff, flowered skirts stopped short at least
three inches above her instep. Virginia
had fortunately very commendable ankles,
and peeping thus from the mass of mould-stained
red and yellow frillings, they looked
as sleek and trim as the neck of a bluebird
peeping from autumnal foliage.</p>

<p>She tilted the little glass forward by
means of one of her discarded shoes thrust
behind it, and darted a shamefaced glance
at her transformed self. Bravo! bravo!
Miss Herrick! You are worthy of that
famous name. So hath Abbey oft drawn
Julia, plenteous in her shining skirts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tresses, beribboned, beautiful. Ah! what
eyes! what lips! what an exquisite expression,
half of self-conceit, half of timid uncertainty!
What a throat for a dove to envy,
supporting the face kissed brown by the
sun, like an orchid whose stem is fairer
than its flower! Snood up that banner of
golden hair, my good Virginia; twist it
about with the string of little shells you
yourself gathered last summer; make yourself
as lovely as possible, my little fawn,
for the sacrifice. The gods have demanded
it from time immemorial&mdash;a band of fair
maidens every year to appease the Minotaur
Despair. Good-by, Virginia; good-by;
good-by. Never again will that dim green
glass reflect such looks from you. Do not
forget the violin. Was it not for him that
you went to fetch it? Is it not for him
that you have forced your strong young
body into the curveless dress of 1761? Is
it not all for him? And even unto the
end will it not be for him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Roden, conscious only of her presence
by the unusual rustling of her skirts, looked
up questioningly. When he saw her, who
she was, he started to his feet, his lips parting
in an expression of utter amaze. It
was as though one of the bepowdered Caryston
dames had stepped from her massive
gilt frame in the hall without and confronted
him. He could say nothing but her
name, in varied tones of astonishment, inquiry,
and approval.</p>

<p>She stood before him on her high heels
as uncertain as a child learning to walk,
smoothing out the much-creased folds of
her gay attire with restless, nervous fingers,
the stringless violin in her other hand.
“I&mdash;I&mdash;I look a awful fool&mdash;don’t I?” she
said, laughing not very merrily. “I&mdash;feel
’s ’f I’d sorter got roots to my feet in these
shoes.” She thrust out one foot, in its incongruity
of yarn stocking and Louis Quinze
slipper, tilted it to one side, and regarded it
in apparent absorption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Roden was only thinking what a charming
picture she made tricked out in all this
red and gold of other days. She stood
there before him like a beautiful present,
clad in the garments of a past as beautiful.
He felt a strange sensation of having
stepped back into the time of Henry Esmond
and the Virginians. He glanced
down at his wrists, half expecting to see
lace ruffles spring to adorn them, under the
magic of the hour.</p>

<p>“You pretty child!” he said at last,
“what on earth made you think of getting
yourself up in this style?” But he knew
that she was more than pretty. He would
have liked to tell her so, only he was always
very careful what he said to this little
Virginian; and florid compliments, though
perfectly adapted to the period of her costume,
would smack of the familiar when considered
under the lights of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>He wondered at the radiance in her suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
lifted face. How could he know that
at last the so often asked question nearest
to her heart was answered, and answered
by him? He thought her pretty!</p>

<p>“I brought you the violin,” she said, turning
away with an effort. “I reckon I’d
better go ’n’ take off these things. They
cert’n’y do look foolish&mdash;don’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, don’t,” said Roden. “You ought to
humor an invalid, you know. You are so
awfully nice to look at in that queer old
gown.”</p>

<p>Dimples that he had never before seen,
just born of joy, stole in and out about
the corners of the girl’s red lips. She was
more even than beautiful; she was enchanting.
How ever had she come by all those
old-time airs and movements? Had she
perchance imbibed the spirit of the past
with the air of the old house where she had
always lived? Did some of those old <i lang="fr">grandes
dames</i> lean from the walls at night to teach
her that subtle, upward carriage of the head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He forgot all about the violin, and stood
looking at her in wondering absorption.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ve got a new song for you,” she
said, presently, in a low voice. She seated
herself sidewise at the piano, as though diffident
of the furbelows that composed the
back of her novel attire, striking at the same
time noiseless chords with her left hand.</p>

<p>“You said you liked Scotch songs. I
found this one in a old book that b’longed
to my mother. She was Scotch. Mus’ I
sing it?”</p>

<p>“Please do,” said Roden.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, she sang to him in the
following words:</p>

<p>Now although Roden had often before
heard her sing, he was conscious of a sound
in her voice to-night which was utterly new
to him&mdash;a sound so marvellous, so altogether
exquisite, so melting sweet, that he was
almost afraid the beating of his heart would
prevent some of its beauty from reaching
him. There was in it a divine fulness
which he had never before heard in a human
voice. It was like the sea on summer
nights. It was like the distant wind in
many leaves. It was like the eternal complaint
of the voices of the fields on April
noons. It filled him with a sense of peace
and unrest at the same time. It thrilled
him and possessed him utterly. Blind that
he was, however, no faintest inkling of what
had produced this divine result came to his
mind. He was touched, but touched only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as he would have been by any other voice
as perfect.</p>

<p>“My dear little girl,” he said, bending
over and kissing her smooth brow with one
of his rash impulses, “we must see what
can be done with that voice. I am thinking
that you will add to the honor of your
name some day, Miss Herrick.”</p>

<p>She started to her feet. It was as though
her very heart’s blood had risen to meet his
lips. A delicate, vivid rose-color dyed all
her brow and temples. “How do you
mean?&mdash;how do you mean?” she said, in a
rough, shaken whisper, holding both hands
against her heart as though afraid it would
leap from her body.</p>

<p>“Never mind what I mean just now,”
he said, with the smile of a wiseacre; “and,
Virginia, since you have sung that song so
charmingly, I am sure that you will be glad
for me about something which I am going
to tell you.”</p>

<p>Glad? Was she not always glad for anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which gave him joy? Had she not
read her eyes almost sightless, night after
night, in mastering that strange horse lore
which would enable her to help him in his
enterprises? She came nearer, in bright
expectancy; lifted her face to meet his
looks and words.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “please tell me. I know
I’ll be glad&mdash;I cert’n’y will.”</p>

<p>“I am engaged to be married,” he told
her. “I am engaged to be married to Miss
Mary Erroll, and&mdash;I want you to be the
first to congratulate me, Virginia.”</p>

<p>He could recall nothing afterwards but
the swift withdrawing of her hands from
his. He could not even remember how
she had left the room. She seemed to
vanish as though in reality she had been
but a wraith summoned up by fancy from
days long fled.</p>

<p>But Virginia? Ah, Virginia! Out, out,
out into the night she sped on supple, unshod
feet. She had torn off those queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
little parodies of shoes at the hall door, and
held them now mechanically to her breast
as she ran.</p>

<p>The air, redolent with peach-blossoms
and hyacinths just born, rushed to meet
her from the dark jaws of the east, as
though some leviathan should breathe with
a sweet breath upon the night May earth.
There was no moon in the lustrous blue-gray
of the heavens, but the stars seemed
trying to atone for her absence by their
multitudinous shining.</p>

<p>As Virginia dashed on past a clump of
box-bushes, her skirts brushing the stiff
leaves set them rattling, and woke the nested
birds to querulous complaints. Her
feet were wet with the night grasses, and
bruised with the pebbles of the carriage-drive.
She reached the lawn gate, opened
it, and rushed through. On, on, across a
field of grass, close-cropped by the not fastidious
sheep, who, warmly folded on a
neighboring hill-side, still nibbled drowsily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
between their slumbers such luscious
blades as were within their reach.</p>

<p>She came at last to a little enclosure set
about with evergreens and almost knee-deep
in withered grass. Her eyes, grown
accustomed to the wan light, could make
out two little hillocks, as it were, formed
within by heaped-up earth, and clasped by
the tangled herbage. Underneath their
sometime verdant rises slept the first twain
who in Virginia bore the name of Caryston.
Side by side, so had they lain, in death together
as in life they had been. Virginia
knew well this their self-chosen resting-place.
Here on summer afternoons would
she come to knit. Here she always brought
the first spring flowers, and here she had
always placed boughs of white and purple
lilacs every day while they lasted. She
had dreamed and wondered and enjoyed
here, and here she came to suffer, as from
some subtle instinct a man turns to his
childhood’s home to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Just outside the wicket gate the daffodils
were all in plenteous blossom, as though
day, for once relenting, had dropped an
armful of gold into the lap of night. On
a locust-tree near by a mocking-bird trilled
and warbled. She cast herself face down
upon one of the graves, clasping it about
with her bare arms, as one clasps a proven
friend in time of trouble. She had spoken
no word as yet. She suffered as keenly, as
dumbly, as any creature, wild or tame, to
whom there is no soul. But all at once a
cry broke from her, then over and over
again, “O my God! O my God! O my
God!”</p>

<p>The sobbing piteousness of this desolate
prayer as it tore its way from the depths of
her wild heart&mdash;who shall write of it? Not
I&mdash;not I&mdash;even if I could. She was a savage;
she suffered like a savage. Will any
say there was no justice in it? It is something,
is it not, to be capable of passion
such as that? She suffered beyond most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
people, men and women, it is true; but was
she not in that much blessed above them?</p>

<p>She lay there until the dawn looked
whitely above the eastern hills upon the
waking earth. In her quaint old dress one
might have thought her the tortured ghost
of the woman who had so long slept in
peace below the grass-hidden mound. She
staggered, when at last she rose to her feet,
and fell for a moment upon her knees.
There was a sense of vagueness that possessed
her. She did not seem to care now,
somehow. She wondered if they would be
married at the little church in the neighborhood,
and if they would let her come. She
thought <em>he</em> would. She thought that she
would not mind much seeing it. Of course
they would live here. She would see them
together every day. Well, what of that?
She was surprised in a dull way that it did
not affect her more. Then she remembered
that she had not made any bread for
him, such as he liked, the night before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Well, it was a pity; but it was too late; it
wouldn’t have time to rise now. She must
think of something else. Morning came
on apace, clad all in translucent beryl-colored
robes, and brow-bound with gold and
with scarlet.</p>

<p>The birds were waking and chattering,
as women chatter over their morning toilets.
Some more hyacinths had bloomed
in the night, and there was a great clump
of iris, that she had not noticed the day
before, on the hill-top. A cardinal-bird,
sweeping downward like a flame fallen
from some celestial fire, made his morning
bath in the hollow of a tulip-tree leaf&mdash;a
relic of vanished winter filled by kindly
spring with fragrant rain.</p>

<p>As she neared the lawn gate she saw
some one leaning over it. A swart, red-kerchiefed
figure, clad in a dress whose
stripes of blue and white circled her large
body as its hoops a barrel. It was Aunt
Tishy. She pushed upon the gate, jamming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
her stout proportions uncomfortably
in her haste to reach the girl.</p>

<p>“Gord! Miss Faginia, whar <em>is</em> you ben?
An’ gret day in de mawnin! what dat you
got on, anyhow? Gord! Gord! ef de chile
ain’ jes ez wet ’s ’f she’d ben caught in de
Red Sea wid Phario. Honey, whar <em>is</em> you
ben, in the name o’ Gord? Tell yo’ mammy.
Is you been see a harnt? What de
matter wid my baby? Gord! Gord! dem
eyes sutney <em>is</em> ben look on suppn dradeful.
Po’ lamb! po’ lamb! Look at dem
little foots, an’ de stockin’s all war offen
’em same as de rats dun neaw ’em. Ain’
yo’ gwine tell yo’ mammy, my lady-bug?
Come ’long so. Mammy kin ’mos’ kyar
yo’ ter de house.”</p>

<p>Virginia submitted listlessly to the old
black’s blandishments. She was not sorry
to have Aunt Tishy’s massive arm about
her. Her feet ached and smarted; there
was a sharp pain in her side when she
drew her breath, and that dreadful feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of being a thing just born, a creature who
had no past, still held her in its numbing
grasp.</p>

<p>Aunt Tishy took her into the big kitchen&mdash;an
out-house consisting of one room,
and a fireplace in which one might have
roasted a whole ox. It was lined on two
sides with great smoke-darkened pine
presses. The other walls and the ceiling
had once been white, but were now stained
the color of a half-seasoned meerschaum
pipe. The two windows had casements
with diamond-shaped panes of dingy glass
set in lead. Enormous deal tables stood
here and there. From the surrounding
gloom came the glimmer of brightly polished
tin, as brilliant in its effect as the
glint of a negro’s teeth from the dusk of
his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div id="illus5" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="400" height="530" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“I GWINE TAKE DAT DAR OUTLANDISH THING OFFEN YO’, HONEY.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Tishy, having seated her nursling
in an old wooden rocking-chair, dragged a
basket of chips and shavings from the capacious
ingle-nook, and set about making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fire. She first scooped away the yet warm
ashes of yesterday with her shapely yellow-palmed
hands. Negroes generally have
well-formed hands and remarkably pretty
finger-nails. Then she began laying a little
foundation of shavings and lightwood splinters;
here and there she stuck a broad
locust-chip. When these preparations
were all completed she went out to “fotch
a light,” she said, assuring Virginia of her
speedy return.</p>

<p>In a few moments she was back, carrying
a handful of live coals in her naked palm,
having first sprinkled a few ashes over it
for protection. With these she kindled
the fire, which soon made a busy clamor in
the hollow throat of the old chimney.</p>

<p>Once more she disappeared, returning
with a bundle of things in her arms: a big
shawl, Virginia’s shoes and stockings, and
her homespun dress.</p>

<p>“I gwine take dat dar outlandish thing
offen yo’, honey,” she announced, seating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
herself on the pine floor in front of
the girl, and beginning to draw off her
torn stockings. “I gwine mek yo’ put
on yo’ own frawk ’fo’ dey sees yo’ in d’
house. Marse Gawge he ain’ knowin’ nuttin’
’bout yo’ bein’ out all night. I ’mos’
skeered to deaf ’bout yo’, but I ain’ seh
nuttin’ to <em>naw</em>body, ’case I didn’t think my
honey gwine g’way fur good.” She took
the little cold bare feet into her cushiony
palms and rubbed them softly. Every now
and then she bent down her gayly turbaned
head and blew with warm breath upon
them after the negro fashion of ministering
to any frozen thing, from a bit of bread to
a young “squawb.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ barf’s all rade-y in de house,” Aunt
Tishy continued, as she knelt up and began
unfastening the ribbons from the front of
the old-time garment the girl had donned
in a mood so different.</p>

<p>“Gord! honey,” she said, as the pins accumulated
in her capacious mouth, “in de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
name o’ sense what dun persess yo’ tuh put
on dis hyah thing? Name o’ Gord! <em>who</em>
ever see sich a thing <em>aney</em>how?” She held
it up with much of the contempt with which
Virginia had at first regarded it, tossing it
finally into the chip-basket.</p>

<p>Virginia said nothing from first to last.
She was almost sure that she was dreaming,
and would soon awake.</p>

<p>“My sakes ’live!” chuckled Aunt Tishy,
as she hooked the homespun dress about
the girl’s waist, “wouldn’ I ’a’ thanked Gord-amighty
ef yo’d ’a’ ben dis good when yo’
wuz leetle, honey? Mk, mh-<em>mph</em>!”</p>

<p>(This final ejaculation I find impossible
to describe with pen and ink.)</p>

<p>When she had completely altered her
charge’s appearance, replaiting her dishevelled
hair, and unwinding from its tangled
meshes the little chain of white and red
sea-shells, Aunt Tishy took her by the hand
and led her across the side lawn to the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now yo’ kin dress comfbul,” she told
her, “an’ jess mek’ yo’se’f easy, my lamb.
Tishy she ain’ gwine seh nuttin’ tuh <em>naw</em>-bode-y.”</p>

<p>Virginia tried to smile upon her. Something
stiff at the corners of her mouth
seemed to prevent her. She turned, lifting
one hand to her cheek, and went into the
yet quiet house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VI">VI.</h2>

<p>Roden wondered a good deal during
such moments as his thoughts reverted
not to his ladylove, concerning Virginia’s
recent neglect of him. Popocatepetl was
his attendant now at meals, dried his newspapers,
and gambolled for his amusement.
Virginia had come to him on the afternoon
of the day following that upon which he
had announced to her his engagement, and
had said she “didn’ know what took her
las’ night. She cert’n’y was glad he was
so happy. He mus’ please scuse her ’f she’d
ben unperlite. She cert’n’y was glad.” But
Roden missed her very much. Besides, he
wished exceedingly to hear her sing again.
He wanted to be quite sure that he had not
deluded himself in regard to the possibilities
contained in her sonorous voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia continued to be very economical
of her presence, however, and three days
afterwards he was summoned to New York
by telegraph to attend the bedside of an
ailing thorough-bred.</p>

<p>Virginia did not come to tell him good-by.
He thought it strange at the moment,
but did not have time to ponder over it
subsequently. She, in the mean time, kneeling
behind the “slats” of her bedroom window-blinds,
watched the little Canadian fishing-wagon
as it drove away, with Popocatepetl
proudly installed on the back seat.
She held something crushed against her
breast&mdash;an old Trinity College boating-cap
which belonged to Roden. She knelt there
for full a half-hour after the last grinding of
the cart-wheels on the carriage-drive. No
tears rose to soothe the burning in her eyes.
She had not wept since that night spent by
those lonely graves. At last she rose and
went over beside the fire. The day was
unusually raw for the season of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebellious robins chattered on the eaves.
A fitful wind swept rudely over the fields.
Virginia, with unseeing eyes on the low-smouldering
fire, caressed the bit of blue
cloth in her hands with absent, slow-moving
fingers. Anon she lifted and examined
it closely. It seemed to her that the lion
on the coat of arms might have been better
done. She remembered an old print of
Daniel in the lions’ den which was in the
big family Bible. Therein the king of beasts
was, she thought, far more ably depicted.
This lion had an inane expression, owing
probably to the two black dots which stood
for his fierce eyes, a paucity of mane, and a
superfluity of tail which struck her as undignified.
Suddenly she burst out laughing.
Peal after peal of the merry, staccato
sound rang through the winding passageways
above, and echoed down into the lower
halls; ripple upon ripple of wild merriment;
a rush, an abandonment of jollity,
in which she had not indulged for many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
day. She tried in vain to stop. She could
not. That little oblong lion with his much-curled
tail was too much for her. Ha! ha!
Oh, how funny&mdash;how funny it was! and
how she enjoyed a good laugh! And was
it not far, far better to laugh than to cry?
Oh, that funny, funny, funny little beast!
How merry he made her, how jolly, how
care-free, once more!</p>

<p>A voice rang out suddenly, calling her
name: “Faginia! O-o-o-o Faginia! O-o-o-o
Faginia!”</p>

<p>Startled into sudden gravity, she slipped
the cap into the breast of her brown stuff
gown, and went to the door.</p>

<p>“That you, father?”</p>

<p>“Yase, ’tis. What ’n th’ name o’ goodness
’r’ you hyahhyahin’ ’bout up thar all by
yo’self? Howsomdever, the beauty of the
question air, thar’s a young lady down here
as wants ter see you, an’ I’d never ’a’ knowed
yo’ was in the house ef yo’ hadn’ been goin’
on like a wil’-cat with the stomach-ache.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is it?” said Virginia.</p>

<p>Back came the name in strident unmistakable
syllables, “Miss&mdash;Ma-ry&mdash;Er-roll.”</p>

<p>There was a second’s pause.</p>

<p>“I’ll be down in a minute,” Virginia
called back.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Erroll was walking up and
down the “front hall” in her Quorn-cloth
habit, whistling softly to herself. Her short
riding-skirt needed no holding up to enable
her to move comfortably, and her hands
were clasped behind her about her hunting-crop.</p>

<p>Virginia, coming slowly down the many
convolutions of the broad stair-way, noticed
the dark sheen of the thick braid folded
away under the smart little hat, the glimpse
of fair cheek and throat, the thorough-bred
lines of the slight figure.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” she said, briefly.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll stopped in the midst of an
intricate aria, unbent her red lips, and held
out her hand in its loose dog-skin glove:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
evidently she intended to ignore the unpleasantness
of their last interview.</p>

<p>“I came to Caryston for two reasons,” she
announced, cheerily. “First, to give your
father a message which Mr. Roden left with
me. Secondly, to bring you something,
Miss Virginia. I believe you like dogs?”</p>

<p>“Some dawgs,” said Virginia, speaking
in a dull, even tone.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll, nothing daunted, led the way
to the library; she pulled off the wrappings
from about a wicker basket, and lifted out
a sturdy mastiff pup, who, supported across
the palm of his whilom mistress’s fair hand,
made ungainly motions with his great paws,
as though trying to swim.</p>

<p>“Won’t you take him, Miss Virginia?
We have so many dogs at home, it would
be a real kindness.”</p>

<p>“Most likely my father ’d like to have
him,” said Virginia. “I don’t have much
time ter ’tend ter dawgs. I’m much obliged
ter you, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Erroll, thus rebuffed, set down the
little mastiff on the floor, and pushed it
with the toe of her riding-boot. One of the
characteristics of this young woman was an
insatiate desire for the good-will of every
one. It was weak, no doubt; but, as the
celebrated saying hath it, the weakness was
very strong. Somehow it made Mary uncomfortable
to think that the overseer’s
daughter, humble though her position was,
should not succumb to the charm which she
chose to exert for her benefit.</p>

<p>The unconscious little peace-offering in
the mean time was making abortive efforts
to peer into every object out of his reach
which the room contained.</p>

<p>A sudden revulsion of feeling came over
Virginia, a sense of unnecessary rudeness,
and of the uselessness of it all.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll take him, thank you,” she said,
stooping and lifting the puppy into her capable
young embrace. “I’m mighty glad to
have him. He cert’n’y is pretty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Virginia! She felt the baldness
of these phrases without knowing how to
remedy them. “He cert’n’y is cunnin’,”
she added.</p>

<p>Mary was much relieved. “I thought
you would like him,” she said. “I have
named him ‘Mumbo,’ after one of his ancestors.
If you don’t like the name, please
be sure to change it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like it!” said Virginia. “I couldn’t
give him a better one to save my life. I
kyarn’t never scarsely think o’ names fur
the critters on th’ farm. Does he know it
yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” Miss Erroll assured her.&mdash;“You’ll
have to teach him that.”</p>

<p>She looked down intently at one of her
gloves, and began to unbutton it. “I suppose
you have heard of my engagement?”
she said, without looking up.</p>

<p>Yes, Virginia had heard of it. She said
so in an even monotone which had in it
no suggestions either of approval or disapproval.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
She was astonished to feel Miss
Erroll’s hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“Miss Virginia,” said that young lady,
with a sweet and whole-souled blush, “I’m
going to ask you to do me a tremendous
favor. I&mdash;I would like so much to see
Jack’s&mdash;Mr. Roden’s room just as he left
it, don’t you know&mdash;with his boots and
coats and whips lying about. I don’t want
your father or any of the servants to know,
because they would think me crazy; but I’m
sure you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>Virginia led the way without a word.
The mastiff pup made playfully affectionate
dabs at her round chin with his rose-leaf
tongue. Roden’s bedroom was on the
ground-floor. He did not occupy the majestically
gloomy apartment in which his
first night at Caryston had been spent.
This room was in the east wing of the
house, plentifully perforated with small casements,
and panelled from floor to ceiling.
This panelling had all been painted white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and the result of the heavy coatings, renewed
from time to time, was a rich, ivory-like
smoothness of tint and tone. A little
single iron bedstead stood in one corner
of the room, between two windows. There
were some capital old sporting prints upon
the walls, numberless hunting-crops and riding-canes
stacked on the high mantle, spurs,
gloves, tobacco-bags, cartridges, and what not
heaped pell-mell on tables and chairs, about
twenty pairs of boots and shoes ranged
along one side of the room, some on and
some not on trees. Garments of divers
kind were pitched recklessly about. It is
perhaps needless to say, after the foregoing
description, that confusion reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll, at first shyly conscious of
Virginia’s presence, soon began to move
about after her usual airy fashion. She
lifted the brier-wood pipe, so often smoked
in Virginia’s presence, and pressed her lips
playfully to its glossy bowl.</p>

<p>“Aren’t women geese, Miss Virginia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
when they care for any one?” she said,
turning to laugh at the girl over her graceful
shoulder.</p>

<p>She was entirely at her ease now, and
went about from object to object, touching
some and merely looking at others, with a
little conscious air of possession which was
like the turning of a rusty knife in the girl’s
heart. She tossed an old shooting-coat
from the bed’s foot to a chair, remarking,
as she did so, “What careless creatures the
best of men are! I shall have to give Master
Jack a lesson in the old proverb concerning
places and things&mdash;when&mdash;when I
am Mrs. Jack!” she ended, merrily.</p>

<p>Turning over some things on a table
near one of the windows she came across
an old-fashioned netted purse of red silk,
with steel rings and tassels&mdash;the purse Virginia
had netted for him during such odd
moments as she could steal from her many
occupations. She watched Miss Erroll now
with hungry eyes, the eyes of a wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
lioness who watches, helpless, the taking
away of one of her cubs. Her heart beat
against her homespun bodice with short,
quick throbs. She stooped and set the
struggling puppy upon the floor. It seemed
to her as though she had been holding fire
in her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is so pretty!” said unconscious
Mary. “This is so very quaint and pretty!
I must have it. Of course he’d give it me.
I’m just going to take it without saying by
your leave;” and with that she slipped it in
the pocket of her habit.</p>

<p>Virginia shut her eyes for a moment,
dizzy with pain and anger; but the red
light which seemed to surround and envelop
her when she did so made her fainter
than ever. She lifted her dark lids and
stared out at the blank strip of sky above
the box-bushes outside the window, vacantly,
unseeingly.</p>

<p>She had no distinct recollection of the
remainder of Miss Erroll’s visit. That one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fact concerning the taking away of the purse
which Roden had promised to keep always
alone remained distinctly in her mind. She
had tried honestly to overcome the all-powerful,
unreasoning dislike of Miss Mary
Erroll, and the result had been worse than
if it had not been tried. The discordant,
insistent yapping of the mastiff pup irritated
her almost beyond endurance. He seemed
bent on intruding upon her his regret for
the departure of his former mistress.</p>

<p>As she went wearily into her father’s
work-room, and sat down to her spinning-wheel,
she heard his voice at the window
calling her.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said, listlessly.</p>

<p>“’Pears to me,” said he, jocosely, “as having
rained, it air cert’n’y pourin’. Heah’s
Joe Scott come ter bring yo’ them jorhnny-jump-ups
he sez as he promised yo’.”</p>

<p>She got violently to her feet, upsetting
the wheel and tearing her skirt against a
projecting nail as she hastened to the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“Tell him I’m sick,” she said. “Tell
him I’m in bade. I ain’t a-goin’ ter see
him; that’s flat. If needs be, tell him so.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Joseph Scott had already entered
the room. He was a person of sinuous,
snake-like presence, and seemed capable of
shedding his complete attire by means of one
deft wriggle. His neck rose from a turn-down
celluloid collar, after the fashion of
the neck of “Alice in Wonderland,” after
she had partaken of the cake which caused
her to exclaim, “Curiouser, and curiouser!”
His long locks, of a vague, smoky tint, exuded
an unsavory smell of (I am ashamed to
say) rancid pomatum. He wore a threadbare
summer overcoat, though in his case the
“over” was a decided misnomer, as there
was nothing under it but an unbleached
cotton shirt, and a sporting vest which had
evidently belonged to some Briton. His
necktie would have put an October forest
to the blush. His mud-colored trousers
were pulled down outside of his great cowhide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
boots, which presented their very apparent
tops in a ridgy circle beneath the
stuff of his trousers.</p>

<p>A strangling sense of loathing and revolt
rose in Virginia’s throat. She felt as
though she would indeed suffocate beneath
that terrible combination of smell and vulgarity.
She leaned far out of the window,
and spoke to him without turning her head.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” she said, curtly. “P’r’aps you
heard me tell father I was sick.”</p>

<p>“Lor’! air you?” said Mr. Scott. “I
cert’n’y am sawry. Here’s them jorhnny-jump-ups
I hearn you seh ez how you
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Virginia, in a stifled
voice. She still leaned out of the window,
and the conversation flagged.</p>

<p>“Larse night,” suddenly announced Mr.
Scott, with spasmodic assertiveness, “Larse
night a peeg-horg came down th’ mounting
and gneawed all pa’s corn orf.”</p>

<p>“He must ’a’ had a mighty leetle crop,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
said Virginia from without the window.
Her voice came back into the room softened
by the purring air without.</p>

<p>“I’m tawkin’ ’bout gyarden corn,” said
Mr. Scott, failing to appreciate the sarcasm.</p>

<p>Again a silence. The mastiff pup, diverted
by the arrival of the new-comer, went
sniffing about his redolent person.</p>

<p>“Ef he was a fox,” thought Virginia,
dryly, “’twouldn’t take no houn’s ter foller
his scent. I could track him a week arter-wards
myself.” Out aloud she said, “Air
them roots or flowers you brought me?”</p>

<p>“Both,” said Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“The tarryfied fever’s a-ragin’ up ter
Annesville,” he announced, presently.</p>

<p>Virginia faced about for the first time.
“Is it?” she asked. “Who’s down?”</p>

<p>“Nigh all o’ them Davises. The doctor
says as how it’s ’count o’ their makin’ fertilizer
in their cellar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div id="illus6" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“HE MUST ’A’ HAD A MIGHTY LEETLE CROP.”</p>
</div>

<p>“What?” said Virginia.</p>

<p>He repeated his assertion.</p>

<p>“Ef that’s true,” she said, slowly, “I ain’
goin’ to bother my head ’bout ’em; such
fools oughter die.”</p>

<p>(Be that as it may, she “bothered” herself
enough to tramp on foot all the way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Annesville, some eight miles, that very
afternoon, and offer her services as sick-nurse.
The house fortunately was under
quarantine, and there was assistance enough.)</p>

<p>“But that ain’ nothin’ ter th’ skyarlet-fever
over the mounting,” Mr. Scott pursued,
in a tone whose threadbare lugubriousness
revealed the morbid satisfaction
which lined it. “That’s fyar howlin’; an’
they sez, moresomeover, ez how it can be
kyard an’ took from a little bit o’ rag.”</p>

<p>Old Herrick, who had come again to the
window, was listening intently. “’S that
so?” he said, finally. “Well, consequently
were, the beauty of that question air, thar
ain’ much rag trade goin’ on between that
side o’ th’ mounting an’ t’other. Hyeah!
hyeah!”</p>

<p>“How can you laugh, father?” said the
girl.</p>

<p>“Godamighty, gyrl! I ain’ laufin’ at the
folks as is got the fever, but at them as
ain’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“They says as how it kin be kep’ in a
piece o’ ribbon or sich fur over twenty
year,” pursued Mr. Scott, who, apparently
not content with his own fragrance, continued
from time to time to bury his long nose
in the bunch of johnny-jump-ups which he
still held.</p>

<p>“’S that so?” said old Herrick again. “I
tell yo’ what, darter, ’f that thar’s true, yo’d
better have them things ez th’ las’ Englisher’s
wife lef up in th’ attic burned up.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Mr. Scott, before Virginia
could reply.</p>

<p>“’Case thar baby died o’ th’ red fever,
and thar’s some o’ its belonging up thar
inter a cradle&mdash;some little odds an’ eens ez
they furgot ter take away with ’em in their
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yo’d cert’n’y better burn ’em,” said Mr.
Scott, with knowing gloom. “I’d as soon
sleep with a bar’l o’ gunpowder over my
hade.”</p>

<p>“Well, seems to me ef there’s danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
’n either, ’twouldn’t be in th’ gunpowder,”
said Miss Herrick, dryly, “seein’ as it don’
never blow down, an’ yo’d be onder it.”</p>

<p>“G’long, Miss Faginia!” exclaimed her
not-to-be-rebuffed admirer. “Yo’d have yo’
joke ’bout a dyin’ minister!”</p>

<p>He left a half-hour afterwards, all unconscious
of the seeds of disaster which he
had sown, and the next day Roden returned
from New York in excellent spirits.
On the following Tuesday he went into the
kitchen and had a private conference with
Aunt Tishy, which resulted in his leaving
it with pockets considerably lightened, and
shoulders laden with the thanks and
praise of its proprietress. He also confided
in Virginia, and asked her assistance.
He wished to give his bride-elect and her
mother a little dinner&mdash;wouldn’t Virginia
help him? She was so very clever about
such things. He knew if she would only
help him that everything would be perfectly
satisfactory. She promised, and he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
off on Bonnibel to Windemere entirely content.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll drove her mother over to
Caryston in a village-cart, and, as luck
would have it, a sudden shower caught
them about a quarter of a mile from the
house. Mary, however, got the brunt of
the shower, as she was driving, and had at
once wrapped her mother in all available
rugs and wraps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Erroll stepped out upon the front
porch at Caryston with the ruffle at her
throat, and a little damp, and the plumes
in her bonnet somewhat limp; but Mary’s
dress of white wool was soaked through
and through, and her hat a sodden mass of
white lace and straw.</p>

<p>Roden relapsed at once into the agonies
of alarm in which newly engaged men are
apt to indulge when the health of their
<i lang="fr">fiancées</i> is called into question. He went
again to Virginia, and overwhelmed her
with instruction and entreaties. Miss Erroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was conducted to a bedroom bright
with blue chintz and many wax-candles,
and Virginia, having provided her with
some of her own clothes, went off to dry
the soaked garments. That, however, Roden
would not hear of. It was too far to
Windemere to send back for dry garments.
Then Virginia must lend Miss Erroll one
of her dresses.</p>

<p>Virginia had three dresses besides the
one she wore. She brought them all in
and laid them on the bed. Miss Mary,
who had an artistic eye, chose a gown of
garnet wool with plain round waist and
short skirt. When she had turned it in a
little at the throat, and fastened a bit of
cambric, which Virginia brought her, kerchiefwise
about her neck, she looked like a
charming Cinderella who had resumed her
humble attire to please her Prince. Mary’s
throat, however, could not stand the severe
test of laceless exposure. It was too slender
and long. Where Virginia’s massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
column of cream-hued flesh rose from the
clasp of such a kerchief with infinite suggestions
of mythical forests and Amazonian
warriors, Miss Erroll announced that she
looked “scraggy.” She took up the bit of
black velvet with its buckle of Scotch pebbles
which she had worn about her throat
when she arrived. But the wet stuff left
dark stains on her fingers, and had assumed
a cottony, lack-lustre hue. “If only I had
a bit of velvet to go about my throat!”
she said, regretfully. “I can’t go down
this way&mdash;I’m so indecently thin!” She
laughed a little and sat down as in despair.</p>

<p>A sudden thought leaped hot in Virginia’s
breast. A bit of velvet? She had
no velvet of any kind, but she knew where
a piece was. A bit of dark-blue velvet ribbon,
just such a bit as Miss Erroll wanted.
True, it had been used to loop a baby’s
sleeve, but around that slender throat it
would reach most amply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;kin&mdash;get&mdash;you a piece,” she heard
herself saying.</p>

<p>Her voice sounded strange and disembodied
to herself, as though it did not issue
from her own lips. She thought that she
to whom she spoke must start up with
horror for the change. But no, she only
smiled blandly, sweetly, with that faint
suggestion of patronage which was as perceptible,
though not as palatable, as the
dash of bitter in orange marmalade.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much!” she said. “I
shall quite suit myself then.”</p>

<p>Virginia took a candle and went up into
the attic, as ten days ago she had gone.
The damp, dusty smell brought back to
her that terrible memory as only a perfume
can recall the past.</p>

<p>Her veins throbbed ever hotter and
fiercer. Her time was come. Revenge
was in her hands. What fever could be
more virulent, more deadly, than the fever
that dark-haired girl had set raging in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
veins? What was the verse that she had
read only last night to Aunt Tishy out
of what the old negress called “de Holy
Wud?” An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth. Joe Scott was not the only person
she had ever heard speak of such a thing.
It had simply served to recall it to her
mind. Ha! ha! She had never liked Joe
Scott before, and she had been very rude
about those johnny-jump-ups. Poor Joe!
She would thank him the very best she
knew how when next she saw him. Poor
Joe! good Joe! dear Joe! Yes, there it
was, the pretty bassinet cradle, with its
faded blue and pink ribbons. That little
English baby had died full four years ago.
She walked towards it, shielding the candle
with one scooped hand from the playful assaults
of the night wind. The cradle stood
just in front of an old hair-covered chest.
As she neared it, a consciousness of eyes
regarding her came upon her. Ah! there
they were. A rat, paralyzed for the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
by the sudden light, had paused on
the edge of the old chest, and fixed her
with his little, protruding, evil-looking eyes.
She made a spasmodic, terrified movement
with her hand, and he leaped down, his
sleek, tight-skinned body striking the floor
with a repulsive sound as of unsavorily nurtured
corpulence. The girl turned with a
strong, uncontrollable fit of shivering towards
the cradle. It was rocking slowly
back and forth in the uncertain light, its
pink and blue ribbons fluttering with a
ghostly and ill-timed gayety. A cry almost
broke from between her gripped lips, but
she remembered suddenly that the rat must
have set it in motion when he leaped from
the top of the chest. Setting the candle on
the floor beside her, she stooped over and
began lifting out the little sheets and blankets
and bundles of linen and silk. One of
those sudden noises which disturb sleep at
night in an old house jarred through the
room. She stuffed the things hastily back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and looked behind her. Nothing there. But
as her glance went round the room she saw
before her, black, assertive, monstrous, the
likeness of a huge cradle, cast by the candle
against the whitewashed wall of the garret.
Her heart beat with laboring, heavy
thuds. If it were not quite so black, she
thought, or if it had only been more the
size of the real cradle; but its vast presence
in the low-roofed room seemed like
the presence of some presiding fate. She
tore away her look from it by sheer force of
will, found what she wanted, caught up the
candle, and rushed headlong from the room.</p>

<p>Miss Erroll received her with the same
sweet smile. “You were pretty long,” she
said. “I’m afraid I’ve given you a lot of
trouble.”</p>

<p>“No, none,” said Virginia. She cleared
her throat and repeated the words. They
were indistinct at first, because of the dryness
of her tongue and the roof of her
mouth. She watched with hot, moveless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
eyes the slim fingers of Miss Erroll as she
first crimped the curling bit of velvet between
her fingers, with a deft, almost imperceptible
movement, and forced the teeth
of her little buckle through it.</p>

<p>“How damp it smells!” she said, as she
lifted it to her throat to put it on; “just as
if it had been stuffed away in some old attic.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s knees smote together. She
put out her hand to steady herself, and
sank heavily into a chair.</p>

<p>“’Taint nuthin’&mdash;’tain’t nuthin’,” she said,
roughly, as Mary ran to her side. “I’m better
jess so. Don’ tech me, please. An’ please
ter scuse me. I kyarn’ bear no one to tech
me when&mdash;when I’m like this.”</p>

<p>Alas! alas! Virginia, when were you
ever “like this” before, in the whole course
of your seventeen years of strength and
health and placid, if bovine, contentment?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dinner, thanks to Virginia, was a
success. Roden’s wines were excellent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
They were going to ask Virginia to sing
for them. Roden said he thought it would
please her so much. After dinner Mrs.
Erroll sat down to the piano, and the sweethearts
wandered off into the “greenhouse,”
leaving open the door between the rooms.
A rhomboid of pale yellow light from the
candles on the dinner-table fell into the narrow,
flower-crowded corridor, touching the
great geranium-leaves into a soft distinctness,
and showing here and there the flame-colored
and snow-white glomes of blossom.</p>

<p>Roden, out of sight of Mrs. Erroll, had
straightway put an arm about the supple
waist of his betrothed, and one of her hands
had found its way to his short curls with a
movement as of long habit. As the slanting
light from the room beyond caught the
sheen of her delicate throat above its velvet
ribbon, he bent his head and pressed down
his lips upon it and upon the bit of velvet.</p>

<p>Virginia, by some strange coincidence
or freak of fate, was at this moment crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the lawn to put the mastiff pup into
his kennel. Attracted by the unusual
light in the greenhouse, she looked up.
Looking up, she saw Roden as he stooped
and kissed his sweetheart’s throat. She
gave a fierce broken cry, like an angered
beast, and turning, ran with all her might
into the house.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Erroll, summoning up musical
ghosts from her maidenhood’s <i lang="fr">répertoire</i>
on the old piano, thought that one of Roden’s
horses had gone mad and galloped
through the room.</p>

<p>In the mean time Virginia, panting, wordless,
seized Mary with one strong hand, and
with the other tore off the velvet from
about her neck. “I&mdash;I&mdash;I’ve read as how
it was pizen; I jess remembered. Here’s
yo’ buckle.”</p>

<p>She rushed madly out again, and flinging
herself upon the bare floor of her little
bedroom, beat the hard boards with her
hand and dragged at her loosened hair.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VII">VII.</h2>

<p>There is One who hath said that to
Him belongeth vengeance. When His
creatures take into their incapable grasp
the javelins of His wrath it is generally
with as impotent and baleful a result as
when young Phaëton, seeking to guide
the chariot of the sun, brought to himself
despair, and scorched to cinders the unoffending
earth. Thus was it with Virginia.
With the nearness of her unbridled
love and anger she had forever seamed
as if with fire the fair world of her content.
It seemed to her that space itself would
be too narrow to hold her apart from such
women as were good and true.</p>

<p>Just God! could it be that her sin was
to be visited upon the being whom of all
the world she loved best, because of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that sin had been committed? Was Roden
going to suffer, perhaps to die, in the
stead of the woman she had sought to
slay? He was not often at Caryston now;
most of his days were spent with his betrothed.
He did not notice the change
which was stealing over Herrick’s daughter.
He had no time to wonder that she
did not sing now at her spinning as once
she had sung. He would not have paused
to listen to her had she done so.</p>

<p>He was called away again to the North
on the last of May, and on the day after
his departure Aunt Tishy burst into Virginia’s
room with flour-covered hands.
“Gord! Gord! honey,” she said, tossing
her blue-checked apron up and down with
wild, savage gestures of dismay and grief,
“what yuh think?&mdash;Marse Jack’s sweetheart’s
dun got de rade fever, an’ dey don’
think as how she’ll live.”</p>

<p>Virginia stood and stared at her with
eyes which saw nothing. Her face took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on a ghastly greenish pallor. About her
brow and mouth there stole a cold moisture.
She opened her lips, and seemed to
speak. Her lips framed the same words
stupidly over and over again.</p>

<p>“Gord! honey,” cried the old negress,
seizing her, as she swayed backward as if
about to fall, “is yuh gwine be sick yuhsef?”</p>

<p>Virginia pushed her away, walked steadily
over to an old oak cupboard, took out
a jug of whiskey, and drank from its green
glass throat as she had seen men do. The
stinging liquid filled her veins with a hot,
false strength. She spoke quickly now,
in a harsh tone, seizing the old nurse by
the shoulders, and thrusting her white face,
with its lambent, distended eyes, close to
that of the terrified Aunt Tishy.</p>

<p>“When was she took? Who tol’ yuh?
Are yuh lyin’? Ef yuh’re lyin’ I’ll curse
yuh with such curses yuh won’ be able
to be still when yuh’re dead. But yuh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wouldn’ lie tuh me, would yuh, mammy?
You wouldn’ lie to me to send me tuh
hell in th’ spirit ’fo’ I was called there fur
good. Yuh hear me? Why didn’ yuh
tell me befo’? Who’s with her? Who’s
nursin’ her? Put up my clo’es. I’m goin’&mdash;I’m
goin’ right now. God! Air yuh
a-tryin’ to hold me? Ha! ha! That’s
good&mdash;that cert’n’y is good. I’ll make
father larf at that when&mdash;when I come
back. Why, you pore old thing, I could
throw you outer that winder ef I tried.
Well, don’t cry. What a’ you cryin’ fur?
God! God! God! have mercy on me!”</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees, wringing her
hands and throwing backward her agonized
face, as though with her uplooking, straining
eyes she would pierce the very floor of
heaven and behold that mercy for which
she pleaded. Then she leaped again to her
feet. All at once a calmness fell upon her.
She resumed the old dull listlessness of some
days past as though it had been a garment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to Mis’ Erroll’s,” she said,
quietly. “I wan’ some clo’es. Send ’em;
I ain’t er-goin’ tuh wait. Tell father.”</p>

<p>Virginia, arrived at Windemere, went
down the basement steps into the kitchen.
The cook, a young mulatto woman named
Lorinda, came forward to meet her on cautious,
brown-yarn toes.</p>

<p>“Miss Mary’s a-dyin’,” she announced,
in a sepulchral whisper. “De doctor seh
ez how she kyarn’ live nohow. She’s jess
ez rade ez a tomarker fum hade tuh foots.
An’ she’s jess pintly ’stracted. Yuh never
heah sich screechin’ an’ tuh-doin’ in all yuh
life.”</p>

<p>“Kin I see Mis’ Erroll?” Virginia said,
shortly. She sat down on an upturned
half-barrel near the door, and leaned with
her forehead in her locked palms. Lorinda,
rebuffed but obliging, went to see. Virginia
was not surprised when she returned
shortly, followed by Mrs. Erroll herself.
Her heart would never quicken its beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
again for anything this side of torment,
she thought. Poor, erring, repentant, suffering
little savage, what are you enduring
now if it be not torment?</p>

<p>Mrs. Erroll, nervous and hysterical, took
the girl’s hands in hers, and scarcely knowing
what she did, bent forward and kissed
her cheek. Virginia started back with a
harsh cry, which was born and died in her
throat.</p>

<p>“Poor child!” Mrs. Erroll said, humbly.
“I beg your pardon. But if you feared contagion
you ought not to have come here.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t that&mdash;’tain’t that,” said Virginia.
“Don’ min’ me; I’m queer like sometimes.
I didn’ mean nuthin’. Ev’ybordy in this
neighborhood ’ll tell yo’ I’m a good nurse.
I’ve come to he’p yo’. I’ve come to take
kyar of her. I’ve come to <em>make</em> her live!”</p>

<p>She lifted one arm with a gesture of
command almost threatening. The next
moment it dropped heavily to her side.
The old dull look crept like a shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
over the momentary animation of her face.
“They’ll tell yo’ I’m a good nurse,” she
said, in her slow monotone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Erroll was only too thankful for the
proffered services. She had no assistance
from the whites in the neighborhood; indeed,
all of the neighboring families had
left for the Virginia Springs.</p>

<p>Virginia, after removing her shoes, went
at once to the sick-room. As her eyes fell
upon the flushed face on the pillow it was
as if every drop of blood in her body turned
first to fire and then to ice.</p>

<p>She stood with her hands against her
breast and looked down at her own work.
The beautiful dark tresses, formerly so
smoothly braided about the small head,
now ever turning from side to side as
though in search of rest which it found
not, were tangled and matted until no
trace of their former lustre remained; the
red lips, ever moving, gave forth wild, incoherent
cries and mutterings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>About the slender throat coiled the
wraith of a dark-blue velvet ribbon.</p>

<p>“Take it off, take it off,” whispered Virginia.
“She kyarn’ git well while that’s
there&mdash;she kyarn’.” Reason came back to
her with a sudden rush, and she knew that
only her mind’s eye saw the velvet ribbon.</p>

<p>She then took her place by the bedside,
from which she did not move to eat or
sleep for twelve days and nights. They
brought her bouillon and made her drink
it under penalty of being turned from the
room. For twelve times four-and-twenty
hours she listened to those senseless ravings.
She was mistaken in turn by the
sick girl for her mother, for some of her
school-room friends, for Roden. Mary
would sometimes put up both narrow, fever-wasted
hands to her little throat, and
cry out that she was choking&mdash;that Virginia
had brought her a band of fire and
locked it about her throat. By what strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
coincidence such a fancy should have possessed
her who shall say?</p>

<p>Thus they went together, those two,
through the Valley of the Shadow&mdash;the
all but murdered, the almost murderess&mdash;and
she who had sought to slay brought
back to life.</p>

<p>Roden, detained by some business complication
in New York, heard nothing of his
sweetheart’s illness until telegraphed for on
the day of the crisis. It was just the balance
of a mote in sunshine between life
and death. Life brought the mote that
won. They told him he must thank Virginia.
They had all thanked her, and
blessed her, with thanks and blessings
which burned her guilty soul with twice
the fire of red-hot maledictions. That they
should bless her whom God had cursed!
Ah, God, she prayed not! She would but
know if God himself wept not because of
the sad mockery.</p>

<p>A wild thought came to her with healing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in its wings, as when a blade of grass
forces its way between the stones in a
prisoner’s cell. She had read of atonement: might
she not atone?</p>

<p>Perhaps God would let her buy forgiveness
with her life. Why had she not taken
the fever; or was this fever now which
rioted through her veins? She was walking
homeward with her shoes slung across
her shoulders. The grass felt cool and
damp against her bare feet. Would it not
wither where she trod? She looked backward
over her shoulder with a laugh. It
seemed to her that her footprints would be
set as with fire across that lush June field.</p>

<p>Then came a curse upon her eyes. For
her the earth lost all its summer green;
the heavens above her bent not bluely
down to meet the blue horizon. The birds
ceased singing, and echoed her mirthless
laugh; all nature took it up&mdash;a monstrous
harmony of jovial sounds. At what were
they making merry, these creatures large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and small&mdash;the crickets, the wild birds, the
many voices of field and forest, of air and
water?</p>

<p>Was it at her they laughed? Did they
jeer at her because she had lost her soul?
Ah, for the cool green to look upon! Ah,
that its blue would return to the lurid
heavens! The curse of blood was upon
her. Because of it she looked on all things
as through a scarlet veil. Red was the
vault above her; red the far-reaching line
of well-loved hills; red, red, the whirling
earth.</p>

<p>Virginia did not die. A week after her
recovery she sent and asked if Roden would
come to her father’s room; she wished to
speak with him.</p>

<p>He went most willingly, having never
felt as though he had sufficiently thanked
her for what she had done for one who was
to him as the life in his veins.</p>

<p>As he entered the room, in spite of all
his self-control he could not restrain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
slight start. Was this Virginia Herrick?&mdash;this
snow maiden with eyes of fire, and
tangled hair that seemed to flame about
her white face as though it would consume
it?&mdash;this fragile, wasted, piteous memory of
a woman? She was as poor a likeness of
her former self as a sketch in white chalk
would be of one of Fortuny’s sunlit glares
of canvas.</p>

<p>He came and stood beside her, wordless,
and then put one of his strong brown hands
kindly on her hair.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said, drawing herself away
from him&mdash;“wait.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Virginia,” he said, in his
breezy, gentle voice, “we will soon have
you out of this. You won’t know yourself
in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said, her great eyes burning
into his.</p>

<p>“My poor little girl,” he said, almost with
tenderness, “I am afraid you have over-estimated
your strength. You had better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
let me go now. I will come to-morrow
whenever you send for me.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said a fourth time, in that
strange, still voice.</p>

<p>He had a horrified doubt in regard to
her reason as he took the chair to which
she pointed and sat down facing her.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with an assumption of
gayety which he was far from feeling,
“what is it? Am I to be scolded for anything?”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in torment?” said the
girl. She kept her hollow, stirless eyes on
his. There was an absence of movement
about her almost oppressive. She seemed
not even to breathe.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said Roden, nervously,
“do choose a more cheerful subject. Really,
you know, it isn’t good for you to be
morbid now. Let’s talk of something jolly
and pleasant. Don’t you want to hear how
the mokes are coming along? And Bonnibel,
poor old girl! I’m afraid her feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
will be awfully hurt when I tell her you
didn’t ask after her.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose ev’ybordy bleeves in torment
that has felt it,” said the girl. She had not
moved in anywise. Her deep, still eyes
yet rested on his face. She seemed drinking
his looks with hers. “I’ve sorter come
ter think as hell’s in th’ hearts o’ people,”
she went on. “There ain’t no flames ez
kin burn like them in people’s hearts.”</p>

<p>Roden jumped to his feet, and went over
beside her. “Virginia,” he said, kindly but
firmly, “I’m not going to let you talk like
this. Good Heaven! those country quacks
know as little about medicine as I do; not
as much, by Jove! for I’d not have let you
leave your bed for a month yet. Come,
dear, let me persuade you. Go back to
bed. I’ll come and see you to-morrow in
your room, if your father’ll let me. You
must, Virginia!”</p>

<p>“It ain’t no worse, do you reckon,” she
went on, dully, “tuh be in hell than tuh have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
hell in you? I’ve thought er heap ’bout it.
I’ve most answered it, but I’d rather&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” said Roden, imperatively.
He thought her delirious, and started to the
door to call her nurse.</p>

<p>“Wait!” rang out her voice, with all its
old, clear strength. She had risen to her
feet. She was there before him. The light
from the window behind her struck through
her hair, so that she seemed standing between
rows of living flame. “I want tuh
tell you,” she said. “I didn’t use tuh think
I was a coward, but I am&mdash;I am!” She
beat the palms of her hands together, and
tossed back her head as though seeking to
be rid of the superflux of agony which tore
her. “I kyarn’ bear to say it tuh yo’; I
kyarn’ bear to hear yo’ curse me, ez I have
so often hearn yo’ in my dreams. I kyarn’
bear&mdash;O God!&mdash;I kyarn’ bear fur yo’ tuh
know me ez I am. O God! O God! this’ll
wipe it out, won’t it? This’ll buy me
peace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Virginia! Virginia!” said Roden, beside
himself. He tried to force her again into
her chair.</p>

<p>“Ah! don’t touch me!” she cried out&mdash;“don’t
yuh touch me, tuh hate me worse
than ever when yuh know&mdash;Listen&mdash;listen
hard, ’cause yuh ain’t a-goin’ to bleeve
me when first yuh hear. Yuh come here tuh
thank me fur savin’ her life. Listen: ’twas
me ez tried to kill her&mdash;’twas me! me! me!”
The last word broke from her with a wild
sob, almost vindictive in its urgent violence.
She seemed like one who scourges mercilessly
his own flesh for its sins against his
soul. “I done it&mdash;I done it. I tried ter
kill her. Listen! You’ve hearn o’ fever
bein’ cyar’d in bits o’ ribbon&mdash;in leetle bits o’
velvet ribbon&mdash;one, two, ten, twenty years?
There was a leetle baby died here onc’t. It
died o’ th’ fever <em>she</em> liked tuh ’a’ died of. I
give her that piece o’ velvet to w’ar roun’
her pretty throat. I went up intuh th’ attic,
an’ hunted an’ hunted till I found it in th’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
baby’s cradle. I give it to her. I tried to
kill her. O my God! Do yo’ want tuh
touch me&mdash;now?”</p>

<p>He stood and stared on her like one
dazed by a sudden blow, though not quite
stunned.</p>

<p>“You are crazy,” he said, thickly. “Poor
Virginia, you are crazy.”</p>

<p>“O God!” she wailed. “I wisht I wuz&mdash;I
wisht I wuz! Oh, ef I wuz only like them
dumb beasts in th’ stables out thar! Ef I
wuz only Bonnibel, then&mdash;then&mdash;then yuh
wouldn’ hate me; an’ ef yuh did, I wouldn’
know.”</p>

<p>“You are raving,” he said again.</p>

<p>“Ask her&mdash;ask her, if yo’ don’ bleeve me.
Ask her ’f Faginia Herrick didn’ bring her
a leetle bit o’ blue velvet to w’ar round her
throat the night she got wet in th’ rain.
She said then it smelt damp like it had
been in a attic. Ask her&mdash;ask her.”</p>

<p>“God in heaven!” said Roden, between
his teeth, “can you be telling me the truth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>He</em> knows I am!&mdash;<em>He</em> knows I am!” she
said, wildly.</p>

<p>Roden turned from her, resting his hand
on the back of the chair in which he had
sat when he first entered the room. His
head drooped. The double horror seemed
like a palpable thing at his side.</p>

<p>“D’ yo’ bleeve me?” she said, with panting
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. She would not have recognized
his voice had he spoken in the dark.</p>

<p>She waited a few moments, motionless,
frozen, as it were, with suspense and dread.
Then she leaned forward, and holding fast
her bosom with her crossed arms in the
gesture usual with her, fixed her dilating
eyes upon him. Was it possible, could it
be true, that after all he could not curse
her? Nay, dear God! was he even going
to forgive her?</p>

<p>“Say something,” she said, in a bated
voice&mdash;“say somethin’. Jess so you don’
curse me, say somethin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he spoke not. She fell upon her
knees and laid her head upon his feet.
“O my God! my God!” she sobbed, “air
yuh goin’ tuh furgive me?”</p>

<p>Then he spoke to her. “Forgive you?”
he repeated&mdash;“forgive you?” He laughed
a short, rough laugh. “By G&mdash;!” he said,
turning away from her, so that her forehead
rested on the bare floor instead of on
his feet, “it’s all I can do not to curse you!”</p>

<p>When she rose again to her knees she
was alone in the darkening room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII.</h2>

<p>Roden did not return to Caryston that
night, nor the next day, nor the day after
that. A boy was sent from Windemere
to bring over some of his boxes. On Monday
of the next week he went with the Errolls
to Old Point Comfort, where Mary
had been ordered to stop during her convalescence.</p>

<p>As much as he despised Virginia for her
confession, that pathetic, joyous cry of hers
as she thought him about to forgive her
would sometimes ring in his ears; her
deep, still, pleading look, as of some dumb
beast, for mercy haunted him at times.
He could feel her forehead on his feet,
and the eager grasp of her hands upon
them. It was not pleasant, all this; for
while it annoyed and even pained him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could not say honestly to himself that he
felt any disposition to forgive her. Forgiveness
is no doubt divine. Roden was
quite sure that it was an attribute which,
like happiness, belonged solely to the gods.
As for himself, he was distinctly, vehemently,
entirely human. He did not forgive&mdash;almost
he did not wish to feel forgiveness.
What! forgive a creature who
had sought to murder his manhood’s one
love? Verily he would be no better than
herself did he so much as dream of pardon.
Between her and her God must rest that
question. He would none of it. And
yet why did that earnest, wistful voice, so
thrilling with a timid exultation, come
ever to his mental ears: “O my God!
my God! air you goin’ ter furgive me?”
Pshaw! what balderdash! He had not
cursed her. Let her comfort herself with
that. He did not know many other men
who would have been as forbearing. And
yet again&mdash;those hands about his feet, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
huddled form prone before him in humblest
entreaty! It made him irritable at
times. He was conscious of having acted
with perfect justness, and yet he felt that
his justness had not been tempered with
overmuch mercy.</p>

<p>In the mean time Virginia lived on, if
one can be said to live whose heart is dead
within her. She did not dare to pray for
death; she did not dare to hope for peace;
she feared to die, poor ignorant child, because
of the roaring flame which waited
to devour her. She feared even more to
live, because of the fire with which she
was already consumed. She never moved
save to go to bed and get up again. Sometimes
she would sit all day out-of-doors
under the great horse-chestnuts, already
shrivelling in the June sunlight. Nothing
roused her; nothing moved her in
anywise. Poor old Herrick would recount
to her his drollest stories, ending
with a vociferous “Hyeah! hyeah!” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hopes of eliciting some answering mirth
from her. But when he had reached the
most excruciatingly funny climax, and
paused to hear her laugh, she would turn
on him her vague, gentle eyes, and say,
“What’s that, father?” or sometimes, “Were
you a-talkin’ ter me, father dear?”</p>

<p>The old man went heavily about his
work. He was like some willing beast too
late in life called upon to support a heavy
burden. He was disgusted and angry to
feel the big tears on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“The beauty of the question air,” he
quoth, angrily, to himself one day, “I ain’t
wuth th’ victuals I eat. I’m a pore ole
fool ez oughter be a-suckin’ ov a sugar
rag, ’stead o’ tendin’ ter er beeg place like
this; but, Godamighty! ef that thar gyrl
don’ git a heap peerter ’fo’ long, I’m gwine
plumb crazy. My sakes! who’d ’a’ ever
thought Faginia would a-set all day like
that a-studyin’ her own han’s like they wuz
the book o’ Gord! Howsomdever, ’tain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
many ez studies th’ book o’ Gord ez faithful
ez my pore leetle gyrl studies them
han’s o’ hern. Somethin’ cert’n’y <em>is</em> out o’
kelter with that thar chile. Godamighty!
ef Faginia wuz ter die&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped blankly in the midst of the
cornfield through which he was walking,
and thrusting his hands deep in his brown
jeans trousers-pockets, looked up appealingly
at the hot blue sky.</p>

<p>That same evening he was summoned
as juryman to Charlottesville, a village
some fifteen miles from Caryston, and as
he kissed Virginia good-by his heart rose
in his throat. The face she lifted to his
was so wan, so patient, so like the face of
her young mother just ere she died, twenty-one
years ago.</p>

<p>“Leetle gyrl&mdash;leetle gyrl,” said the old
man, brokenly, “ef you don’ want tuh hurry
yo’ father tuh his grave, yo’ll hurry en
take them purty leetle foots out o’ yourn.
Darter, honey, try ’n’ git some o’ them ole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
red roses in them white cheeks. Please,
Faginia, honey, I’m ’mos’ worrited to death
’long o’ you.”</p>

<p>“Pore father!” she said, stroking his face&mdash;“pore
father!” that was all. Her listless
hand fell again into her lap. Her eyes fixed
themselves with their vague, uncomprehending
look upon the far blue distance. She
was as much apart from him as though she
were already dead. He rose to his feet,
strangling a sob in his brave old throat,
that he might not distress her, and rode
manfully away to his unpleasant duty.</p>

<p>That night a dreadful thing occurred at
Caryston. The “mill stable,” as it was
generally called, from being built on a hill
just above the mill-pond, caught on fire.
There were four of Roden’s most valuable
horses in it, together with Bonnibel, who
had been moved from the house stables
while they were undergoing alteration.</p>

<p>Virginia was sitting silent by her bedroom
window when the first copper glare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
began to tinge the dense upward column of
black smoke. She knew in a minute what
it was, although Aunt Tishy muttered something
about “bresh” fires.</p>

<p>She leaped to her feet, her heart once
more renewing its old-time measure. “Mammy!”
she called&mdash;“Mammy! that’s th’ mill
stable! th’ mill stable’s on fire! O God
above! Th’ pore horses&mdash;an’ Bonnibel!
O pore Mr. Jack&mdash;pore Mr. Jack! Ef Bonnibel’s
hurt, it’ll break his heart.” She had
forgotten everything in her thought for him.
Her own sin, his harsh words&mdash;all that had
passed between them since first he gave
Bonnibel into her glad keeping.</p>

<p>“Here!” she called, tossing on her clothes
with nervous, eager fingers, “han’ me my
shoes&mdash;quick!&mdash;Lord God!&mdash;ef only I ken
git thar in time!”</p>

<p>She was down-stairs and out of the house
almost before the old negress knew what
she was about to undertake. Out at a side
gate she dashed, and down a grassy hill at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the back of the house. Some catalpa-tree
roots caught at her flying feet with their
knotty fingers as though, fiend-like, they
would hinder her on her errand of mercy.
On, on; her breath came quick and laboring.
She was on the open road now, straining
with all her might up a steep, stone-roughed
hill. All the northern heavens
were ablaze with an angry orange. As she
gained the top of the hill a little fan of lilac
flames burst from the stable roof against
the night. There was yet time&mdash;Bonnibel
was in a loose-box near the door. O God,
the other horses! Must they roast alive&mdash;the
beautiful, agile creatures that he so
loved?</p>

<p>Below, in the placid breast of the large
pond, the lurid mass above was reflected
with an effect as incongruous as when
some world-tossed soul pours out its hot
confession into the calm keeping of a saintly
heart.</p>

<p>The shallow stream shoaled into fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
among the black stems of the water-reeds,
and tossed the flames upon its mimic waves.
She gained the rough bridge which spanned
it; her feet passed with a swift, hollow
sound across it. She was there&mdash;at the
stable, and her breath had not yet given
out. Then all at once she remembered.
Oh, joy! joy! If she saved Bonnibel, and
was herself hurt to death, would not that
be atonement? Might he not forgive her
then? Poor little savage child&mdash;poor,
sweet, uncivilized, true heart! I think indeed
he would forgive you if he knew.</p>

<p>There were men running frantically
about&mdash;omnipresent&mdash;useless: they had
delayed so long to set about extinguishing
the fire that it was now beyond all bounds.
The wild, dull trampling of the hoofs of
the terrified horses made horror in the air.
They whinnied and nickered like children
pleading for help. One of the English
grooms was dashing into the smoke and
heat. Virginia seized him by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m coming with you,” she said; “let
me keep hold of your coat.”</p>

<p>Alas! alas! the maddened, silly brutes
refused to follow. They reared madly
whenever approached, and struck with their
fore-feet at the plucky little lad. In no way
could he approach them; threats and cajolery
were in vain. Virginia snatched a
whip from the stable wall and tried to beat
them out. Usurper, vicious to the last,
rushed furiously at her, and but for the
lad’s striking him over the head with a
pitchfork, would inevitably have dashed her
brains out with his wicked hoofs. There
was no further time to be lost. One side
of the roof was blazing ominously, and the
wall on the eastern side began to tremble.</p>

<p>Virginia, in spite of entreaties and hands
held out to stop her, turned her skirts about
her head and went into Bonnibel’s box.
“Six of us ’ave tried to get ’er out, miss,”
said the panting lad, who had followed her.
“Don’t you venture in, for God’s sake, miss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
she’s that mad she’ll kill you&mdash;th’ poor
hussy!”</p>

<p>Bonnibel was in truth like a horse distraught.
She was leaping back and forth,
and trotting from side to side of her capacious
box, nickering from time to time,
with head aloft and tail held like a plume
above her satin quarters. No sooner did
she hear Virginia’s voice than she stopped
short, quivering in every splendid limb and
sinew.</p>

<p>“Bonnibel!” said Virginia, in that soft
monotone the frightened creature had not
now heard for many a day&mdash;“Bonnibel!”
There was a second’s pause; then stooping
her bright head, with a low whinny as of
welcome and trust, the gallant mare came
to the well-known voice.</p>

<p>Virginia tore off her woollen shawl and
blindfolded the bright eyes.</p>

<p>In the mean time the rest of the English
lads and the head groom had arrived, with
fire-engines and more help. They had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
succeeded in getting the horse out.
The vicious Usurper they were compelled
to leave to his awful fate.</p>

<p>“Boys, Bonnibel’s coming!” yelled the
lad who had entered the stable with Virginia,
dashing out ahead of her; “Miss
Herrick’s got her, and she’s coming kind
as a lamb!”</p>

<p>A hearty, roaring cheer went up from
without, mingled with exultant warwhoops
from the negroes gathered around.</p>

<p>Almost they were safe. Why do things
happen with only an inch between safety
and destruction? One instant more and
horse and woman would have been free.
But in that tarrying instant a heavy beam
from the front of the stable fell crashing
down, bringing with it a great mass of
bricks and mortar. Virginia and Bonnibel
were half buried under the reeking
mass. The flames sent up an exultant
roar as of triumph. There was a smothered,
horrified groan from the men, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Bonnibel, freeing herself by one powerful
effort of her iron quarters, galloped off into
the coolness of the night.</p>

<p>They pulled Virginia out, with such gentleness
as they could spare to the encroaching
flames, and a bed was instantly made for
her on the damp turf by means of the men’s
hastily torn-off coats. She lay there, still,
white, most beautiful, with peace at last
upon her tired face. Did she dream, perchance,
that he forgave her?</p>

<p>Ah! but the horror that followed&mdash;the
crash succeeding crash, the hideous rioting
of the vengeful flames about the poor
brutes within. Some were suffocated, some
jammed to death beneath the continually
falling masses of stone and brick. Usurper,
dauntless, rebellious to the last, struck
with his iron-shod feet at the flames that
made too free with him. He was so magnificent
in his fierce disdain that more than
one of the grooms sobbed like girls at the
fate which had overtaken him. All at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a cry, piercing, shrill, terrible above any
sound which had ever come upon their
hearing, shook the stillness of the night to
shuddering echoes. It was the one and only
sign of pain that Usurper gave ere he sank
to an awful death among the blazing ruins.</p>

<p>Virginia’s senses returned to her as they
were carrying her home in solemn silence
and with bared heads. She tried to lift
herself on one elbow, and sank back with a
moan of pain; but even for that there went
up some muttered thanks from the men who
carried her. They had thought her dead.</p>

<p>“Does the moving pain you, miss?” asked
the lad who had been with her in Bonnibel’s
box.</p>

<p>“It hurts some,” she said, bravely.
“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>They had to tell her all about the fire,
as though it were a thing new to her, and
how she had saved Bonnibel.</p>

<p>“Oh, did I?” she said. “Did I?&mdash;air
yuh sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, miss?” echoed the admiring Hicks.
“Sure? Well, I think we be pretty sure o’
that ’ere! Bean’t we, boys?”</p>

<p>They could not say enough.</p>

<p>One thought was making music in Virginia’s
heart. “Perhaps he’ll forgive me
now,” she said over and over to herself.
She looked upward at the starry heavens
through the broad leaves of the catalpa-trees,
as they bore her up the last hill to
the house, with a feeling closely akin to
joy. “I’ve saved Bonnibel,” she thought&mdash;“I’ve
saved Bonnibel, anyways; ef he don’t
forgive me, I’ve done, somethin’ to make
him glad. ’Twas awful in that burnin’
place; but I saved her&mdash;I saved her&mdash;I
saved her.” She said the last three words
out loud.</p>

<p>“That you did, miss,” said the boy Hicks,
who walked close beside her. “Tell her
again, boys.”</p>

<p>They told her over and over again, first
one and then the other; she seemed never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
tired of listening. For the first time in
many, many days her white lips fell into
the gracious curves they used to know so
well. She was smiling&mdash;smiling for sheer
happiness. She was hurt to death, she
knew that; something whispered it in her
glad ears as distinctly as though the good
God had bent from his great heavens himself
to tell her so; and she knew&mdash;ah! she
knew&mdash;that her God had forgiven her.
Death had brought her two gifts so sweet
in his chill arms that his embrace scarcely
frightened her. As they carried her with
slow carefulness up the front steps and
into the wide hall an innocent fancy seized
her; she would like so much to die in Mr.
Jack’s room&mdash;on his little iron bed. There
couldn’t be any harm, could there? She
looked so wistfully up into the face of little
Hicks that he felt she wanted something,
and asked her what it was.</p>

<p>“Kyar me into Mr. Jack’s room,” she
whispered. “It’s&mdash;it’s nearer the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The pretty subterfuge was also a very
good one. It would have been almost mortal
anguish to her, had they sought to bear
her poor wrecked body up that winding
stair-way.</p>

<p>So into “Mr. Jack’s room” they carried
her, and placed her full gently on his forsaken
bed.</p>

<p>Aunt Tishy came hurrying with inarticulate
cries. They hushed her as best they
might, telling her that any disturbance
might kill the girl. Then little Hicks
mounted one of Roden’s best horses and
dashed off in search of a surgeon.</p>

<p>Virginia lay quiet and quite content, staring
with wide-open eyes at the well-known
objects in the airy room. Another delightful
fancy seized upon her. Ah! it was good
to lie there and die, and pretend that she
had been his wife, and that it was her right
to die in there with all those much-loved
manly kickshaws about her: the Scotch
deer-stalker’s cap, which hung on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the sconces of a little mirror over the mantle;
that heap of glittering spurs on a table
near at hand; his whip; his boots; an old
blue flannel shirt on the bed’s foot. She
had not allowed any one to enter his room
since he left for Windemere, nor had she
herself been in it.</p>

<p>And even if he didn’t forgive her, she
saved Bonnibel. Suddenly there came upon
her an awful, crashing agony.</p>

<p>“Mammy! mammy!” she called, in her
childhood’s voice. She clung to her old
nurse with might and main. “Oh, mammy,
mammy, I’m payin’ fur it! Yuh don’ know,
but I’m payin’ fur it. I’m so glad&mdash;I’m so
glad! Mammy, sing me ’bout ’though yo’
sins be as scarlet’&mdash;sing! sing!”</p>

<p>The old negress, as well as she could for
sobbing, sang to her in such words as these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“’Tis de old ship o’ Zion,</div>
<div class="verse">Come to take us all ho-ome&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Glory, glory, hallelujah!</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis de old ship o’ Zion,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Come to take us all home&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Glory, glory, hallelujah!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here she broke off with a pitiful cry: “O
Gord! my sweet lamb, mammy kyarn’ sing
to you while her heart’s fyar breakin’ in her.
Don’ ask pore mammy tuh sing, my honey&mdash;don’,
don’!”</p>

<p>“Sing, please, sing,” said the girl, with
gentle insistence. Her mind was failing
her a little for the first time. “God alluz
furgives, don’ he, mammy? Alluz, alluz.
Sing ’bout it, mammy; please, mammy,
sing.”</p>

<p>The old negress went on, brokenly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We has landed many thousands&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Hallelujah!</div>
<div class="verse">An’ we’ll lan’ many mo-re&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Hallelujah!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Please sing ’bout the sins, mammy;
that’s what I want&mdash;’bout the sins.”</p>

<p>The poor old woman crooned on, swaying
her body to and fro as she crouched
at the bedside:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Do’ yo’ sins be as skyarlet,</div>
<div class="verse">Dey shall be as white as snow&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Glory, glory, hallelujah!</div>

<div class="verse">’Tis Jesus is deir Capt’in&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Hallelujah!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“White ez snow&mdash;white ez snow,” murmured
the girl. “Mammy, do yo’ bleeve
that? Ain’t it sweet, mammy? don’ it
seem good an’ kind? Mammy, yo’ see
that ole blue shirt a-hangin’ thar? I loves
that shirt, mammy, same as some women
loves their children. It’s sorter got his
shape now, ain’t it? Hand it here, mammy.
Don’ it smell good?&mdash;kinder briery
an’ soapy, mammy? He used to take
more barths ’n any man yo’ ever hearn
ov. I used ter hear him a-splashin’ clear
up in my room. Where’s father, mammy?
I do want to see father, an’ I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to see Bonnibel ’fore I go. She came to
me&mdash;oh, so sweet an’ lovin’! She knew
I’d ’a’ died fur her, I reckon. Mammy,
did yo’ sen’ fur father? Pore father! pore
father! he’ll be so sorry! Oh, pore father!”
Here the first tears she had shed rolled
over her white cheeks. The old negress
sobbed out aloud.</p>

<p>“Oh, my honey!” she said&mdash;“oh, my little
lamb!&mdash;oh, my honey!”</p>

<p>Again came that terrible pain, almost beyond
her power to endure.</p>

<p>“I’m payin’ fur it&mdash;I’m payin’ fur it,”
she said, over and over again. “God’s so
good to me! He’s forgiven me; he’s lettin’
me pay fur it.”</p>

<p>The surgeon came at daybreak. He
was quiet and serious. Little Hicks was
the only one to whom he told anything.
To him he said, “She may live two or
three days; she may die before night.”</p>

<p>At one o’clock next day old Herrick returned.
He was wordless and almost majestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in his deep grief. All day long he
sat holding her in such positions as would
ease her; talking to her; trying to follow
her wandering fancies. She knew him
always, though she knew no one else.
“Father,” she said, suddenly, in one of the
intervals when reason returned to her,
“won’t you please sen’ fur Mr. Jack?
Somethin’ in my heart tells me he’ll come&mdash;now.
Write to him ’bout Bonnibel. Tell
him I saved her. Tell him I jess want ter
say good-by. I don’ wan’ him ever ter furgive
me. I only want to&mdash;to look at him
once more. Father”&mdash;wistfully&mdash;“<em>you</em>
think he’ll come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my little girl, I think he’ll
come.”</p>

<p>“Then write, write, father&mdash;quick. Don’
let it be too late. I wan’ so bad to look at
him once more!”</p>

<p>He came&mdash;oh yes, he came! mad with
regret and remorse, repentant, eager to
atone. “Where is she? where is she?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
he asked as he threw down his hat upon
the hall table, and jerked off his spurs, that
their jingling might not disturb her. If
he had only known the music that they
made to her ears!</p>

<p>“She’s in yo’ room, sur. They tells me
ez how ’twar her fancy to be took thar,”
said Herrick, simply. “I hope ez you don’
min’, sur.”</p>

<p>Mind! Jack’s eyes were hot with the
saddest tears of all his life.</p>

<p>He went in softly. There she lay, pathetic,
fragile as some long-ill child upon
his narrow bed. He went and stooped
over her, taking into one of his brown
hands her restless, slender fingers. Her
gentle look rested unknowingly upon him.</p>

<p>“Ain’t they goin’ ter sen’ fur Mr. Jack?”
she said. “I think he’ll come&mdash;now; father
thought ez how he would. Please
write it down that I saved Bonnibel&mdash;please
write that down. ’Twas mighty hot,
but I saved her. Oh, don’ yo’ think he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
come?&mdash;don’ yo’ think he’ll come? I don’
even arst him to speak to me. Ef he’ll
only stand in th’ door so ez I kin see him
when I go.”</p>

<p>“Virginia&mdash;Virginia,” said Roden, brokenly.
“My dear little girl, don’t you
know me? Here I am!&mdash;here&mdash;at your
side. Don’t you feel my hands, Virginia?
Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>She went rambling on. “I wonder ef
he would furgive me ef he knew? I wisht
Bonnibel could tell him&mdash;I wisht I was
Bonnibel!” with a little rippling laugh infinitely
pathetic. “Oh, wouldn’ I kyar him
pretty an’ straight at his fences, an’ win
ev’y race fur him!” Her eyes opened
vague and sorrowful again upon Roden’s
pale face. “Oh,” she said, with a long
sighing breath, “don’t you think he’ll come?
Write to him ’bout Bonnibel&mdash;please write
that ter him.”</p>

<p>“Virginia, look at me&mdash;look at me,” said
the young man, half lifting her in his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
“Dear little Virginia, here I am. I forgive
you with all my heart and soul, Virginia.
Oh, please look at me, please remember
me.”</p>

<p>“Who says ‘furgive?’” she said, with her
restless, eager eyes searching the room as
if for something long expected&mdash;“who says
‘furgive?’”</p>

<p>“I do, I do,” Roden said, weeping at last
like any girl. “I forgive you, Virginia&mdash;Virginia.
You <em>shall</em> know me!”</p>

<p>Her eyes fixed themselves upon his face,
first vacantly, then with a wonder-stricken
radiance. “Mr. Jack,” she said, under her
breath, “did they tell yo’? I saved her;
that’s all. Yo’ needn’ say nothin’; I jess
wanted to look at yo’. I saved her. ’Twas
awful hot. I kin hear it roarin’ now. She
come to me; she wouldn’ come to nobody
else.”</p>

<p>“Virginia,” said Roden, “listen to me;
stop talking. What do I care about Bonnibel?
Child, do you want to break my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
heart? Listen, Virginia; I forgive you&mdash;I
<em>forgive you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;you&mdash;really?” she said, with the
old timid joy in her soft voice. “I ain’t
dreamin’? Well, God’s so good to me!
But I did save her. ‘Bonnibel!’ I said&mdash;‘Bonnibel!’
an’ she come right straight ter
me with her pretty head tucked down.
Then came all that fire on us. I thought
’twas over. But I saved her&mdash;I saved her.
Please tell him that&mdash;<em>please</em> tell him that.
I reckon he’ll sorter remember me kind fur
that; don’ you, father?”</p>

<p>After a while her reason came again.
She asked to see Bonnibel; they could
bring her to the window, she said, and she
would like also to give her a handful of
grass.</p>

<p>They rolled the bed to the window, and
little Hicks led Bonnibel up beside it. Roden
went out himself and gathered a handful
of fresh grass. I think the lad only respected
his master more for the tears that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ran down his cheeks. He couldn’t see
very distinctly himself just then, this good
little Hicks.</p>

<p>“Bonnibel,” said the girl, in her cooing
tones&mdash;“Bonnibel.”</p>

<p>What was the matter? Had suffering
charged some magic in that soft voice?
Bonnibel turned indifferently away from
the anxious hand, and rubbed her bright
head with an impatient movement against
one of her fore-legs.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the girl, while the glad flush
died out of her face, and the green blades
fell from her hold upon the window-sill,
“Bonnibel don’ know me any more&mdash;she
don’ care. I gave my life for her, an’&mdash;an’
she don’ care.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she does&mdash;she does,” said Roden,
frantic for her disappointment; “she’s just
gorged, the little glutton! She’s been out
at grass ever since you saved her, Virginia
dear; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“No, ’tain’t,” said the girl, sadly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ain’t the same, I reckon; I reckon I’m right
near gone, Mr. Jack. Well, I saved her,
anyhow. The most part fell on me; she
kicked herself loose. Please, father, ef Mr.
Jack don’ come in time&mdash;<em>please</em>, father, tell
him ez how I saved Bonnibel. Oh, father,
I mus’ tell somebody ’fore I go. I kyarn’
bear to think there won’t be anybody in
all th’ world ez knows it when I’m gone.
I loved him, father dear&mdash;I loved him so!
An’ I’ve been mighty wicked; an’ God’s been
mighty good ter me; an’ I’m goin’ to heaven,
mammy says. But I won’t have him even
there&mdash;I won’t have him&mdash;even there.”</p>

<p>The soft voice broke suddenly&mdash;stopped.
The bright head dropped forward on her
breast.</p>

<p>Roden had buried his face in her two
pale hands. When he looked up, old Herrick
was closing gently with his toil-roughened
hand the sweet wide eyes which never
more would look on anything this side the
stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this moment that Bonnibel, repenting,
perhaps, of her former coldness,
thrust in her little deer-head at the open
window, and drew a long sighing breath as
of contentment.</p>

<p>The blades of grass dropped from the
thin hand now so still upon the stirless
bosom were blown along the window-sill
by the mare’s warm breath.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
